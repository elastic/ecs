    The data_stream fields take part in defining the new data stream naming scheme.

    In the new data stream naming scheme the value of the data stream fields combine to the name of the actual data
    stream in the following manner `{data_stream.type}-{data_stream.dataset}-{data_stream.namespace}`. This means the fields
    can only contain characters that are valid as part of names of data streams. More details about this can be found in
    this https://www.elastic.co/blog/an-introduction-to-the-elastic-data-stream-naming-scheme[blog post].

    An Elasticsearch data stream consists of one or more backing indices, and a data stream name forms part of the backing indices names.
    Due to this convention, data streams must also follow index naming restrictions. For example, data stream names cannot include \, /, *, ?, ", <, >, |, ` `.
    Please see the Elasticsearch reference for additional https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-create-index.html#indices-create-api-path-params[restrictions].
  fields:

    - name: type
      level: extended
      type: constant_keyword
      example: logs
      # Any future values for `data_stream.type` should also adhere to the following restrictions (these are derived from the Elasticsearch index restrictions):
      # * Must not contain `-`
      # * Must not start with `+` or `_`

        An overarching type for the data stream.

        Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future.
      short: An overarching type for the data stream.

    - name: dataset
      level: extended
      type: constant_keyword
      example: nginx.access
      description: >
        The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data.

        Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that
        do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the
        same value as `data_stream.dataset`.

        Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:
          * Must not contain `-`
          * No longer than 100 characters
      short: The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data.

    - name: namespace
      level: extended
      type: constant_keyword
      example: production

        A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data.

        Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this
        best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`.

        Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:
          * Must not contain `-`
          * No longer than 100 characters
      short: A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data.
