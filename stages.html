<title>ECS Proposal Stages</title>

<h1>ECS Proposal Stages</h1>

<p>These are the stages that an individual RFC advances through before being released for general availability in the Elastic Common Schema (ECS). See the <a href="https://github.com/elastic/ecs/blob/master/PROPOSING_CHANGES.md">Contributing Guide</a> for broader details about contributing changes to ECS through the RFC process.
