- name: service
  description: >
    The service fields describe the service for / from which the data was collected.

    If logs or metrics are collected from Redis, `service.name` would be `redis`. This allows
    to find and correlate logs for a specicic service or even version with `service.version`.

  fields:
    - name: id
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Unique identifier of the running service.

        This id should uniquely identify this service. This makes it possible
        to correlate logs and metrics for one specific service. For example
        in case of issues with one redis instance, it's possible to filter on the id
        to see metrics and logs for this single instance.

    - name: name
      type: keyword
      example: "elasticsearch"
      description: >
        Name of the service data is collected from.

        The name is normally the same as the module name.

    - name: version
      type: keyword
      example: "3.2.4"
      description: >
        Version of the service the data was collected from.

        This allows to look at a data set only for a specific version of a service.

    - name: host
      type: keyword
      example: "elasticsearch:9200"
      description: >
        Host address that is used to connect to the service.

        This normally contains hostname + port.

        REVIEW: Should this be service.uri instead, sometimes it's more then just the host?
        It could also include a path or the protocol.

- name: request
  fields:
    - name: rtt
      type: long
      description: >
        Request round trip time.

        How long did the request take to fetch metrics from the service.

        REVIEW: THIS DOES NOT EXIST YET IN ECS.

      example: 115

- name: error
  description: >
    Error namespace

    Use for errors which can happen during fetching information for a service.
  fields:
    - name: message

- name: host
  fields:
    - name: hostname
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Hostname of the system metricbeat is running on or user defined name.

    - name: timezone.offset.sec
      type: long
      description: >
        Timezone offset of the host in seconds.

    - name: id

- name: event
  fields:
    - name: module
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Name of the module this data is coming from.
      example: mysql
    - name: dataset
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Name of the dataset.

        This contains the information which is currently stored in metricset.name
        and metricset.module.
