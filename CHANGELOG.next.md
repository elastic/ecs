## Unreleased

### Schema Changes

* Added `log.file.path` to capture the log file an event came from. #802

#### Breaking changes

#### Bugfixes

* Field `registry.data.strings` should have been marked as an array field. #790

#### Added

* Add architecture and imphash for PE field set. (#763)
* Added `agent.build.*` for extended agent version information. (#764)
* Added `x509.*` field set. (#762)
* Added more account and project cloud metadata. (#816)
* Added missing field reuse of `pe` at `process.parent.pe` #868

#### Improvements

* Remove misleading pluralization in the description of `user.id`, it should
  contain one ID, not many. #801
* Clarified misleading wording about multiple IPs in src/dst or cli/srv. #804
* Improved verbiage about the MITRE ATT&CKÂ® framework. #866

#### Deprecated

* Deprecate guidance to lowercase `http.request.method` #840

### Tooling and Artifact Changes

#### Breaking changes

* Removed field definitions at the root of documents for fieldsets that
  had `reusable.top_level:false`. This PR affects `ecs_flat.yml`, the csv file
  and the sample Elasticsearch templates. #495, #813
* Removed the `order` attribute from the `ecs_nested.yml` and `ecs_flat.yml` files. #811
* In `ecs_nested.yml`, the array of strings that used to be in `reusable.expected`
  has been replaced by an array of objects with 3 keys: 'as', 'at' and 'full'. #864

#### Bugfixes

* Subsets are created after duplicating reusable fields now so subsets can
  be applied to each reused instance independently. #753
* Quoted the example for `labels` to avoid YAML interpreting it, and having
  slightly different results in different situations. #782
* Fix incorrect listing of where field sets are nested in asciidoc,
  when they are nested deep. #784
* Allow beats output to be generated when using `--include` or `--subset` flags. #814
* Field parameter `index` is now correctly populated in the Beats field definition file. #824

#### Added

#### Improvements

* Add support for reusing official fieldsets in custom schemas. #751
* Add full path names to reused fieldsets in `nestings` array in `ecs_nested.yml`. #803
* Allow shorthand notation for including all subfields in subsets. #805
* Add support for Elasticsearch `enabled` field parameter. #824
* Add `ref` option to generator allowing schemas to be built for a specific ECS version. #851
* Add `template-settings` and `mapping-settings` options to allow override of defaults in generated ES templates. #856
* When overriding ECS field sets via the `--include` flag, it's no longer necessary
  to duplicate the field set's mandatory attributes. The customizations are merged
  before validation. #864
* Add ability to nest field sets as another name. #864
* Add ability to nest field sets within themselves (e.g. `process` => `process.parent`). #864
* New attribute `reused_here` is added in `ecs_nested.yml`. It obsoletes the
  previous attribute `nestings`, and is able to fully capture details of other
  field sets reused under this one. #864
* When chained reuses are needed (e.g. `group` => `user`, then `user` => many places),
  it's now necessary to force the order with new attribute `reusable.order`. This
  attribute is otherwise optional. It's currently only needed for `group`. #864
* There's a new representation of ECS at `generated/ecs/ecs.yml`, which is a deeply nested
  representation of the fields. This file is not in git, as it's only meant for
  developers working on the ECS tools. #864
* Jinja2 templates now define the doc structure for the AsciiDoc generator. #865
