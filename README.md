# Elastic Common Schema (ECS)

The Elastic Common Schema (ECS) defines a common set of fields for
ingesting data into Elasticsearch. A common schema helps you correlate
data from sources like logs and metrics or IT operations
analytics and security analytics.

## Documentation

The ECS reference is published on the main Elastic documentation website.
Visit [the official ECS Reference Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html).
