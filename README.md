# Elastic Common Schema (ECS)

The Elastic Common Schema (ECS) defines a common set of fields for
ingesting data into Elasticsearch. A common schema helps you correlate
data from sources like logs and metrics or IT operations
analytics and security analytics.

ECS is still under development and backward compatibility is not guaranteed. Any
feedback on the general structure, missing fields, or existing fields is appreciated.
For contributions please read the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Versions

The master branch of this repository should never be considered an
official release of ECS. You can browse official releases of ECS
[here](https://github.com/elastic/ecs/releases).

Please note that when the README.md file and other generated files
(like schema.csv and template.json) are not in agreement,
the README.md should be considered the official spec.
The other two files are simply provided as a convenience, and may not always be

## <a name="base"></a> Base fields

The `base` field set contains all fields which are on the top level. These fields are common across all types of events.


| Field  | Description  | Level  | Type  | Example  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a name="@timestamp"></a>@timestamp | Date/time when the event originated.<br/>This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.<br/>If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.<br/>Required field for all events. | core | date | `2016-05-23T08:05:34.853Z` |
| <a name="tags"></a>tags | List of keywords used to tag each event. | core | keyword | `["production", "env2"]` |
| <a name="labels"></a>labels | Custom key/value pairs.<br/>Can be used to add meta information to events. Should not contain nested objects. All values are stored as keyword.<br/>Example: `docker` and `k8s` labels. | core | object | `{'application': 'foo-bar', 'env': 'production'}` |
| <a name="message"></a>message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer.<br/>For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.<br/>If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | core | text | `Hello World` |


## <a name="agent"></a> Agent fields

The agent fields contain the data about the software entity, if any, that collects, detects, or observes events on a host, or takes measurements on a host.

Examples include Beats. Agents may also run on observers. ECS agent.* fields shall be populated with details of the agent running on the host or observer where the event happened or the measurement was taken.


| Field  | Description  | Level  | Type  | Example  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a name="agent.version"></a>agent.version | Version of the agent. | core | keyword | `6.0.0-rc2` |
| <a name="agent.name"></a>agent.name | Custom name of the agent.<br/>This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if for example two Filebeat instances are running on the same host but a human readable separation is needed on which Filebeat instance data is coming from.<br/>If no name is given, the name is often left empty. | core | keyword | `foo` |
| <a name="agent.type"></a>agent.type | Type of the agent.<br/>The agent type stays always the same and should be given by the agent used. In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if two Filebeat instances are run on the same machine. | core | keyword | `filebeat` |
| <a name="agent.id"></a>agent.id | Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists).<br/>Example: For Beats this would be beat.id. | core | keyword | `8a4f500d` |
| <a name="agent.ephemeral_id"></a>agent.ephemeral_id | Ephemeral identifier of this agent (if one exists).<br/>This id normally changes across restarts, but `agent.id` does not. | extended | keyword | `8a4f500f` |


Examples: In the case of Beats for logs, the agent.name is filebeat. For APM, it is the agent running in the app/service. The agent information does not change if data is sent through queuing systems like Kafka, Redis, or processing systems such as Logstash or APM Server.


## <a name="client"></a> Client fields

A client is defined as the initiator of a network connection for events regarding sessions, connections, or bidirectional flow records.

For TCP events, the client is the initiator of the TCP connection that sends the SYN packet(s). For other protocols, the client is generally the initiator or requestor in the network transaction. Some systems use the term "originator" to refer the client in TCP connections. The client fields describe details about the system acting as the client in the network event. Client fields are usually populated in conjunction with server fields.  Client fields are generally not populated for packet-level events.

Client / server representations can add semantic context to an exchange, which is helpful to visualize the data in certain situations. If your context falls in that category, you should still ensure that source and destination are filled appropriately.


| Field  | Description  | Level  | Type  | Example  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a name="client.address"></a>client.address | Some event client addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field.<br/>Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | extended | keyword |  |
| <a name="client.ip"></a>client.ip | IP address of the client.<br/>Can be one or multiple IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. | core | ip |  |
| <a name="client.port"></a>client.port | Port of the client. | core | long |  |
| <a name="client.mac"></a>client.mac | MAC address of the client. | core | keyword |  |
| <a name="client.domain"></a>client.domain | Client domain. | core | keyword |  |
| <a name="client.bytes"></a>client.bytes | Bytes sent from the client to the server. | core | long | `184` |
| <a name="client.packets"></a>client.packets | Packets sent from the client to the server. | core | long | `12` |


## <a name="cloud"></a> Cloud fields

Fields related to the cloud or infrastructure the events are coming from.


| Field  | Description  | Level  | Type  | Example  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a name="cloud.provider"></a>cloud.provider | Name of the cloud provider. Example values are aws, azure, gcp, or digitalocean. | extended | keyword | `aws` |
| <a name="cloud.availability_zone"></a>cloud.availability_zone | Availability zone in which this host is running. | extended | keyword | `us-east-1c` |
| <a name="cloud.region"></a>cloud.region | Region in which this host is running. | extended | keyword | `us-east-1` |
| <a name="cloud.instance.id"></a>cloud.instance.id | Instance ID of the host machine. | extended | keyword | `i-1234567890abcdef0` |
| <a name="cloud.instance.name"></a>cloud.instance.name | Instance name of the host machine. | extended | keyword |  |
| <a name="cloud.machine.type"></a>cloud.machine.type | Machine type of the host machine. | extended | keyword | `t2.medium` |
| <a name="cloud.account.id"></a>cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment.<br/>Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | extended | keyword | `666777888999` |


Examples: If Metricbeat is running on an EC2 host and fetches data from its host, the cloud info contains the data about this machine. If Metricbeat runs on a remote machine outside the cloud and fetches data from a service running in the cloud, the field contains cloud data from the machine the service is running on.


## <a name="container"></a> Container fields

Container fields are used for meta information about the specific container that is the source of information.

These fields help correlate data based containers from any runtime.


| Field  | Description  | Level  | Type  | Example  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a name="container.runtime"></a>container.runtime | Runtime managing this container. | extended | keyword | `docker` |
| <a name="container.id"></a>container.id | Unique container id. | core | keyword |  |

## <a name="destination"></a> Destination fields

Destination fields describe details about the destination of a packet/event.

Destination fields are usually populated in conjunction with source fields.


| Field  | Description  | Level  | Type  | Example  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a name="destination.address"></a>destination.address | Some event destination addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field.<br/>Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | extended | keyword |  |
| <a name="destination.ip"></a>destination.ip | IP address of the destination.<br/>Can be one or multiple IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. | core | ip |  |

## <a name="event"></a> Event fields

The event fields are used for context information about the log or metric event itself.

A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened. Log events must include the time at which the thing happened. Examples of log events include a process starting on a host, a network packet being sent from a source to a destination, or a network connection between a client and a server being initiated or closed. A metric is defined as an event containing one or more numerical or categorical measurements and the time at which the measurement was taken. Examples of metric events include memory pressure measured on a host, or vulnerabilities measured on a scanned host.


| Field  | Description  | Level  | Type  | Example  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a name="event.id"></a>event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | core | keyword | `8a4f500d` |
| <a name="event.kind"></a>event.kind | The kind of the event.<br/>This gives information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event.

| <a name="event.category"></a>event.category | Event category.<br/>This contains high-level information about the contents of the event. It is more generic than `event.action`, in the sense that typically a category contains multiple actions. Warning: In future versions of ECS, we plan to provide a list of acceptable values for this field, please use with caution. | core | keyword | `user-management` |
| <a name="event.action"></a>event.action | The action captured by the event.<br/>This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | core | keyword | `user-password-change` |
| <a name="event.outcome"></a>event.outcome | The outcome of the event.<br/>If the event describes an action, this fields contains the outcome of that action. Examples outcomes are `success` and `failure`. Warning: In future versions of ECS, we plan to provide a list of acceptable values for this field, please use with caution. | extended | keyword | `success` |
| <a name="event.type"></a>event.type | Reserved for future usage.<br/>Please avoid using this field for user data. | core | keyword |  |

| <a name="event.dataset"></a>event.dataset | Name of the dataset.<br/>The concept of a `dataset` (fileset / metricset) is used in Beats as a subset of modules. It contains the information which is currently stored in metricset.name and metricset.module or fileset.name. | core | keyword | `stats` |
| <a name="event.severity"></a>event.severity | Severity describes the original severity of the event. What the different severity values mean can very different between use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events. | core | long | `7` |
| <a name="event.original"></a>event.original | Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity.<br/>This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. | core | (not indexed) | `Sep 19 08:26:10 host CEF:0&#124;Security&#124; threatmanager&#124;1.0&#124;100&#124; worm successfully stopped&#124;10&#124;src=10.0.0.1 dst=2.1.2.2spt=1232` |
| <a name="event.hash"></a>event.hash | Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to demonstrate log integrity. | extended | keyword | `123456789012345678901234567890ABCD` |

| <a name="event.timezone"></a>event.timezone | This field should be populated when the event's timestamp does not include timezone information already (e.g. default Syslog timestamps). It's optional otherwise.<br/>Acceptable timezone formats are: a canonical ID (e.g. "Europe/Amsterdam"), abbreviated (e.g. "EST") or an HH:mm differential (e.g. "-05:00"). | extended | keyword |  |
| <a name="event.created"></a>event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline.<br/>This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event.<br/>In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source.<br/>In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | core | date |  |
| <a name="event.start"></a>event.start | event.start contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed. | extended | date |  |
| <a name="event.end"></a>event.end | event.end contains the date when the event ended or when the activity was last observed. | extended | date |  |

This is a tool-agnostic standard to identify flows.<br/>Learn more at https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec. | extended | keyword | `1:hO+sN4H+MG5MY/8hIrXPqc4ZQz0=` |
| <a name="network.bytes"></a>network.bytes | Total bytes transferred in both directions.<br/>If `source.bytes` and `destination.bytes` are known, `network.bytes` is their sum. | core | long | `368` |
| <a name="network.packets"></a>network.packets | Total packets transferred in both directions.<br/>If `source.packets` and `destination.packets` are known, `network.packets` is their sum. | core | long | `24` |


## <a name="observer"></a> Observer fields

An observer is defined as a special network, security, or application device used to detect, observe, or create network, security, or application-related events and metrics.

This could be a custom hardware appliance or a server that has been configured to run special network, security, or application software. Examples include firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, network monitoring sensors, web application firewalls, data loss prevention systems, and APM servers. The observer.* fields shall be populated with details of the system, if any, that detects, observes and/or creates a network, security, or application event or metric. Message queues and ETL components used in processing events or metrics are not considered observers in ECS.


| Field  | Description  | Level  | Type  | Example  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a name="observer.mac"></a>observer.mac | MAC address of the observer | core | keyword |  |
| <a name="observer.ip"></a>observer.ip | IP address of the observer. | core | ip |  |
| <a name="observer.hostname"></a>observer.hostname | Hostname of the observer. | core | keyword |  |
| <a name="observer.vendor"></a>observer.vendor | observer vendor information. | core | keyword |  |
| <a name="observer.version"></a>observer.version | Observer version. | core | keyword |  |
| <a name="observer.serial_number"></a>observer.serial_number | Observer serial number. | extended | keyword |  |
| <a name="observer.type"></a>observer.type | The type of the observer the data is coming from.<br/>There is no predefined list of observer types. Some examples are `forwarder`, `firewall`, `ids`, `ips`, `proxy`, `poller`, `sensor`, `APM server`. | core | keyword | `firewall` |


## <a name="organization"></a> Organization fields

The organization fields enrich data with information about the company or entity the data is associated with.

These fields help you arrange or filter data stored in an index by one or multiple organizations.


| Field  | Description  | Level  | Type  | Example  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a name="organization.name"></a>organization.name | Organization name. | extended | keyword |  |
| <a name="organization.id"></a>organization.id | Unique identifier for the organization. | extended | keyword |  |


## <a name="os"></a> Operating System fields

The OS fields contain information about the operating system.


The `os` fields are expected to be nested at: `host.os`, `observer.os`, `user_agent.os`.

Note also that the `os` fields are not expected to be used directly at the top level.

| Field  | Description  | Level  | Type  | Example  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a name="os.platform"></a>os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | extended | keyword | `darwin` |
| <a name="os.name"></a>os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | extended | keyword | `Mac OS X` |
| <a name="os.full"></a>os.full | Operating system name, including the version or code name. | extended | keyword | `Mac OS Mojave` |
| <a name="os.family"></a>os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | extended | keyword | `debian` |
| <a name="os.version"></a>os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | extended | keyword | `10.14.1` |
| <a name="os.kernel"></a>os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | extended | keyword | `4.4.0-112-generic` |


## <a name="process"></a> Process fields

These fields contain information about a process.

These fields can help you correlate metrics information with a process id/name from a log message.  The `process.pid` often stays in the metric itself and is copied to the global field for correlation.


| Field  | Description  | Level  | Type  | Example  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a name="process.pid"></a>process.pid | Process id. | core | long |  |
| <a name="process.name"></a>process.name | Process name.<br/>Sometimes called program name or similar. | extended | keyword | `ssh` |
| <a name="process.ppid"></a>process.ppid | Process parent id. | extended | long |  |
| <a name="process.args"></a>process.args | Array of process arguments.<br/>May be filtered to protect sensitive information. | extended | keyword | `['ssh', '-l', 'user', '10.0.0.16']` |
| <a name="process.executable"></a>process.executable | Absolute path to the process executable. | extended | keyword | `/usr/bin/ssh` |
| <a name="process.title"></a>process.title | Process title.<br/>The proctitle, some times the same as process name. Can also be different: for example a browser setting its title to the web page currently opened. | extended | keyword |  |

| <a name="process.start"></a>process.start | The time the process started. | extended | date | `2016-05-23T08:05:34.853Z` |
| <a name="process.working_directory"></a>process.working_directory | The working directory of the process. | extended | keyword | `/home/alice` |


## <a name="related"></a> Related fields

This field set is meant to facilitate pivoting around a piece of data.

Some pieces of information can be seen in many places in an ECS event. To facilitate searching for them, store an array of all seen values to their corresponding field in `related.`.

A concrete example is IP addresses, which can be under host, observer, source, destination, client, server, and network.forwarded_ip. If you append all IPs to `related.ip`, you can then search for a given IP trivially, no matter where it appeared, by querying `related.ip:a.b.c.d`.


| Field  | Description  | Level  | Type  | Example  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a name="related.ip"></a>related.ip | All of the IPs seen on your event. | extended | ip |  |


## <a name="server"></a> Server fields

A Server is defined as the responder in a network connection for events regarding sessions, connections, or bidirectional flow records.

For TCP events, the server is the receiver of the initial SYN packet(s) of the TCP connection. For other protocols, the server is generally the responder in the network transaction. Some systems actually use the term "responder" to refer the server in TCP connections. The server fields describe details about the system acting as the server in the network event. Server fields are usually populated in conjunction with client fields. Server fields are generally not populated for packet-level events.

Client / server representations can add semantic context to an exchange, which is helpful to visualize the data in certain situations. If your context falls in that category, you should still ensure that source and destination are filled appropriately.


| Field  | Description  | Level  | Type  | Example  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a name="server.address"></a>server.address | Some event server addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field.<br/>Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | extended | keyword |  |
| <a name="server.ip"></a>server.ip | IP address of the server.<br/>Can be one or multiple IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. | core | ip |  |
| <a name="server.port"></a>server.port | Port of the server. | core | long |  |
| <a name="server.mac"></a>server.mac | MAC address of the server. | core | keyword |  |
| <a name="server.domain"></a>server.domain | Server domain. | core | keyword |  |
| <a name="server.bytes"></a>server.bytes | Bytes sent from the server to the client. | core | long | `184` |
| <a name="server.packets"></a>server.packets | Packets sent from the server to the client. | core | long | `12` |


## <a name="service"></a> Service fields

The service fields describe the service for or from which the data was collected.

These fields help you find and correlate logs for a specific service and version.


| Field  | Description  | Level  | Type  | Example  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a name="service.id"></a>service.id | Unique identifier of the running service.<br/>This id should uniquely identify this service. This makes it possible to correlate logs and metrics for one specific service.<br/>Example: If you are experiencing issues with one redis instance, you can filter on that id to see metrics and logs for that single instance. | core | keyword | `d37e5ebfe0ae6c4972dbe9f0174a1637bb8247f6` |
| <a name="service.name"></a>service.name | Name of the service data is collected from.<br/>The name of the service is normally user given. This allows if two instances of the same service are running on the same machine they can be differentiated by the `service.name`.<br/>Also it allows for distributed services that run on multiple hosts to correlate the related instances based on the name.<br/>In the case of Elasticsearch the service.name could contain the cluster name. For Beats the service.name is by default a copy of the `service.type` field if no name is specified. | core | keyword | `elasticsearch-metrics` |
| <a name="service.type"></a>service.type | The type of the service data is collected from.<br/>The type can be used to group and correlate logs and metrics from one service type.<br/>Example: If logs or metrics are collected from Elasticsearch, `service.type` would be `elasticsearch`. | core | keyword | `elasticsearch` |
| <a name="service.state"></a>service.state | Current state of the service. | core | keyword |  |
| <a name="service.version"></a>service.version | Version of the service the data was collected from.<br/>This allows to look at a data set only for a specific version of a service. | core | keyword | `3.2.4` |
| <a name="service.ephemeral_id"></a>service.ephemeral_id | Ephemeral identifier of this service (if one exists).<br/>This id normally changes across restarts, but `service.id` does not. | extended | keyword | `8a4f500f` |


## <a name="source"></a> Source fields

Source fields describe details about the source of a packet/event.

Source fields are usually populated in conjunction with destination fields.


| Field  | Description  | Level  | Type  | Example  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a name="source.address"></a>source.address | Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field.<br/>Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | extended | keyword |  |
| <a name="source.ip"></a>source.ip | IP address of the source.<br/>Can be one or multiple IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. | core | ip |  |
| <a name="source.port"></a>source.port | Port of the source. | core | long |  |
| <a name="source.mac"></a>source.mac | MAC address of the source. | core | keyword |  |
| <a name="source.domain"></a>source.domain | Source domain. | core | keyword |  |
| <a name="source.bytes"></a>source.bytes | Bytes sent from the source to the destination. | core | long | `184` |
| <a name="source.packets"></a>source.packets | Packets sent from the source to the destination. | core | long | `12` |


## <a name="url"></a> URL fields

URL fields provide support for complete or partial URLs, and supports the breaking down into scheme, domain, path, and so on.


| Field  | Description  | Level  | Type  | Example  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a name="url.original"></a>url.original | Unmodified original url as seen in the event source.<br/>Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path.<br/>This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not. | extended | keyword | `https://www.elastic.co:443/search?q=elasticsearch#top or /search?q=elasticsearch` |
| <a name="url.full"></a>url.full | If full URLs are important to your use case, they should be stored in `url.full`, whether this field is reconstructed or present in the event source. | extended | keyword | `https://www.elastic.co:443/search?q=elasticsearch#top` |
| <a name="url.scheme"></a>url.scheme | Scheme of the request, such as "https".<br/>Note: The `:` is not part of the scheme. | extended | keyword | `https` |
| <a name="url.domain"></a>url.domain | Domain of the url, such as "www.elastic.co".<br/>In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a domain name. In this case, the IP address would go to the `domain` field. | extended | keyword | `www.elastic.co` |
| <a name="url.port"></a>url.port | Port of the request, such as 443. | extended | integer | `443` |
| <a name="url.path"></a>url.path | Path of the request, such as "/search". | extended | keyword |  |
| <a name="url.query"></a>url.query | The query field describes the query string of the request, such as "q=elasticsearch".<br/>The `?` is excluded from the query string. If a URL contains no `?`, there is no query field. If there is a `?` but no query, the query field exists with an empty string. The `exists` query can be used to differentiate between the two cases. | extended | keyword |  |
| <a name="url.fragment"></a>url.fragment | Portion of the url after the `#`, such as "top".<br/>The `#` is not part of the fragment. | extended | keyword |  |
| <a name="url.username"></a>url.username | Username of the request. | extended | keyword |  |
| <a name="url.password"></a>url.password | Password of the request. | extended | keyword |  |


## <a name="user"></a> User fields

The user fields describe information about the user that is relevant to the event.

Fields can have one entry or multiple entries. If a user has more than one id, provide an array that includes all of them.


The `user` fields are expected to be nested at: `client.user`, `destination.user`, `host.user`, `server.user`, `source.user`.

Note also that the `user` fields may be used directly at the top level.

| Field  | Description  | Level  | Type  | Example  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a name="user.id"></a>user.id | One or multiple unique identifiers of the user. | core | keyword |  |
| <a name="user.name"></a>user.name | Short name or login of the user. | core | keyword | `albert` |
| <a name="user.full_name"></a>user.full_name | User's full name, if available. | extended | keyword | `Albert Einstein` |
| <a name="user.email"></a>user.email | User email address. | extended | keyword |  |
| <a name="user.hash"></a>user.hash | Unique user hash to correlate information for a user in anonymized form.<br/>Useful if `user.id` or `user.name` contain confidential information and cannot be used. | extended | keyword |  |


## <a name="user_agent"></a> User agent fields

The user_agent fields normally come from a browser request.

They often show up in web service logs coming from the parsed user agent string.


| Field  | Description  | Level  | Type  | Example  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a name="user_agent.original"></a>user_agent.original | Unparsed version of the user_agent. | extended | keyword | `Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 12_1 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/12.0 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1` |
| <a name="user_agent.name"></a>user_agent.name | Name of the user agent. | extended | keyword | `Safari` |
| <a name="user_agent.version"></a>user_agent.version | Version of the user agent. | extended | keyword | `12.0` |
| <a name="user_agent.device.name"></a>user_agent.device.name | Name of the device. | extended | keyword | `iPhone` |





# <a name="use-cases"></a>Use cases

These are example on how ECS fields can be used in different use cases. Most use
cases not only contain ECS fields but additional fields which are not in ECS to
describe the full use case. The fields which are not in ECS are in italic.

Contributions of additional uses cases on top of ECS are welcome.

 * [APM](use-cases/apm.md)
 * [Auditbeat](use-cases/auditbeat.md)
 * [Beats](use-cases/beats.md)
 * [Filebeat Apache](use-cases/filebeat-apache-access.md)

# <a name="reserved-names"></a>Reserved Section Names

ECS does not define the following field sets yet, but the following are expected
in the future. Please avoid using them:

- `match.*`
- `protocol.*`
- `threat.*`
- `vulnerability.*`

# <a name="implementing-ecs"></a>Implementing ECS

## Guidelines

* The document MUST have the `@timestamp` field.
* The [data type](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-types.html)
  defined for an ECS field MUST be used.
* It SHOULD have the field `ecs.version` to define which version of ECS it uses.
* As many fields as possible should be mapped to ECS.

**Writing fields**

* All field names must be lower case
* Combine words using underscore
* No special characters except `_`

**Naming fields**

* *Present tense.* Use present tense unless field describes historical information.
* *Singular or plural.* Use singular and plural names properly to reflect the field content. For example, use `requests_per_sec` rather than `request_per_sec`.
* *General to specific.* Organise the prefixes from general to specific to allow grouping fields into objects with a prefix like `host.*`.
* *Avoid repetition.* Avoid stuttering of words. If part of the field name is already in the prefix, do not repeat it. Example: `host.host_ip` should be `host.ip`.
* *Use prefixes.* Fields must be prefixed except for the base fields. For example all `host` fields are prefixed with `host.`. See `dot` notation in FAQ for more details.
* Do not use abbreviations. (A few exceptions like `ip` exist.)

**How to populate ECS fields**

In order to maximize the level of interoperability of your data with future analysis content
(e.g., saved searches, visualizations, dashboards, alerts, machine learning jobs,
reports, apps, etc.); whether this content is provided by Elastic
or shared by the community, please keep the following guidelines in mind.


* Start by populating ECS Core fields. These fields are the most common across
  all use cases. Your implementation should attempt to populate as many of
  the ECS Core fields as practical.
  * ...even if these fields or values are metadata that are not present in your
    original event. For example, a firewall event shipped to the Elastic Stack
    over syslog may not actually include a field with value ”syslog,” but the
    ECS `agent.type` field should still be set to “syslog."
  * ...even if the data has already been mapped to one ECS field. For example,
    if you’ve mapped your event’s client IP address to ECS `client.ip`, you can
    also copy the same value to ECS `source.ip` and append it to `related.ip`.
* Populate as many ECS Extended fields as apply to the subject and use case of
  your event. ECS Extended fields generally apply to more narrow use cases,
  so feel free to skip ECS Extended fields that are not applicable to your use case.
* You're free to choose whether to copy your event fields to ECS fields,
  leaving your original fields intact as custom fields, or to rename your existing
  event fields to ECS, essentially migrating them to the ECS field names.
  Future ECS content and applications will depend only upon the presence of
  the ECS fields, and will ignore any custom fields.

## Normalization

In order to be help allow for correlation across different sources, ECS must sometimes
enforce normalization on field values.

### Lowercase Capitalization

Some field descriptions mention they should be normalized to lowercase. Different approaches
can be taken to accomplish this. The goal of requesting this is to avoid the same value
appearing distinctly in aggregations, or avoid having to search for all capitalizations possible (e.g. IPV4, IPv4, ipv4).

The simplest implementation of this requirement is to lowercase the value before indexing in Elasticsearch.
This can be done with a Logstash filter or an Ingest Node processor, for example. Another approach that
satisfies the goal is to configure the keyword indexing of the field to use
[a normalize filter using the lowercase filter](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/normalizer.html).
The normalize filter leaves your data unmodified (the document still shows "IPv4", for example).
However the value in the index will be lowercase. This satisfies the requirement of
predictable querying and aggregation across data sources.

## Understanding ECS conventions

### Multi-fields text indexing

Elasticsearch can index text multiple ways:

* [text](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/text.html)
  indexing allows for full text search, or searching arbitrary words that
  are part of the field.
* [keyword](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/keyword.html)
  indexing allows for much faster
  [exact match filtering](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-term-query.html),
  [prefix search](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-prefix-query.html),
  and allows for [aggregations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations.html)
  (what Kibana visualizations are built on).

By default, unless your index mapping or index template specifies otherwise
(as the ECS index template does),
Elasticsearch indexes text field as `text` at the canonical field name,
and indexes a second time as `keyword`, nested in a multi-field.

Default Elasticsearch convention:

* Canonical field: `myfield` is `text`
* Multi-field: `myfield.keyword` is `keyword`

For monitoring use cases, `keyword` indexing is needed almost exclusively, with
full text search on very few fields. Given this premise, ECS defaults
all text indexing to `keyword` at the top level (with very few exceptions).
Any use case that requires full text search indexing on additional fields
can simply add a [multi-field](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/multi-fields.html)
for full text search. Doing so does not conflict with ECS,
as the canonical field name will remain `keyword` indexed.

ECS multi-field convention for text:

* Canonical field: `myfield` is `keyword`
* Multi-field: `myfield.text` is `text`

#### Exceptions

The only exceptions to this convention are fields `message` and `error.message`,
which are indexed for full text search only, with no multi-field.
These two fields don't follow the new convention because they are deemed too big
of a breaking change with these two widely used fields in Beats.

Any future field that will be indexed for full text search in ECS will however
follow the multi-field convention where `text` indexing is nested in the multi-field.

### IDs and most codes are keywords, not integers

Despite the fact that IDs and codes (e.g. error codes) are often integers,
this is not the case across all systems. IDs can also be alphanumeric, or contain
special characters.
Since we want to make it possible to map as many systems and data sources
to ECS as possible, we default to using the `keyword` type for IDs and codes.

Some specific kinds of codes are always integers, like HTTP status codes.
For these fields specifically, using `long` can be considered.

# <a name="about-ecs"></a>FAQ

## What are the benefits of using ECS?

The benefits to a user adopting these fields and names in their clusters are:

* **Data correlation.** Ability to easily correlate data from the same or different sources, including:
    * data from metrics, logs, and apm
    * data from the same machines/hosts
    * data from the same service
* **Ease of recall.** Improved ability to remember commonly used field names (because there is a single set, not a set per data source)
* **Ease of deduction.** Improved ability to deduce field names (because the field naming follows a small number of rules with few exceptions)
* **Reuse.** Ability to re-use analysis content (searches, visualizations, dashboards, alerts, reports, and ML jobs) across multiple data sources
* **Future proofing.** Ability to use any future Elastic-provided analysis content in your environment without modifications

## What if I have fields that conflict with ECS?

The [rename processor](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rename-processor.html) can help you resolve field conflicts. For example, imagine that you already have a field called "user," but ECS employs `user` as an object. You can use the rename processor on ingest time to rename your field to the matching ECS field. If your field does not match ECS, you can rename your field to `user.value` instead.

## What if my events have additional fields?

Events may contain fields in addition to ECS fields. These fields can follow the ECS naming and writing rules, but this is not a requirement.

## Why does ECS use a dot notation instead of an underline notation?

There are two common key formats for ingesting data into Elasticsearch:

* Dot notation: `user.firstname: Nicolas`, `user.lastname: Ruflin`
* Underline notation: `user_firstname: Nicolas`, `user_lastname: Ruflin`

For ECS we decided to use the dot notation. Here's some background on this decision.

### What is the difference between the two notations?

Ingesting `user.firstname: Nicolas` and `user.lastname: Ruflin` is identical to ingesting the following JSON:

```
"user": {
  "firstname": "Nicolas",
  "lastname": "Ruflin"
}
```

In Elasticsearch, `user` is represented as an [object datatype](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/object.html). In the case of the underline notation, both are just [string datatypes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-types.html).

NOTE: ECS does not use [nested datatypes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/nested.html), which are arrays of objects.

### Advantages of dot notation

With dot notation, each prefix in Elasticsearch is an object. Each object can have [parameters](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/object.html#object-params) that control how fields inside the object are treated. In the context of ECS, for example, these parameters would allow you to disable dynamic property creation for certain prefixes.

Individual objects give you more flexibility on both the ingest and the event sides.  In Elasticsearch, for example, you can use the remove processor to drop complete objects instead of selecting each key inside. You don't have to know ahead of time which keys will be in an object.

In Beats, you can simplify the creation of events. For example, you can treat each object as an object (or struct in Golang), which makes constructing and modifying each part of the final event easier.

### Disadvantage of dot notation

In Elasticsearch, each key can only have one type. For example, if `user` is an `object`, you can't use it as a `keyword` type in the same index, like `{"user": "nicolas ruflin"}`. This restriction can be an issue in certain datasets. For the ECS data itself, this is not an issue because all fields are predefined.

### What if I already use the underline notation?

Mixing the underline notation with the ECS dot notation is not a problem. As long as there are no conflicts, they can coexist in the same document.
