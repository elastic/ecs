    - name: tty.char_device.major
      description: >
        The major number identifies the driver associated with the device. The character device's major and minor numbers can be algorithmically combined to produce the more familiar terminal identifiers such as "ttyS0" and "pts/0". For more details, please refer to the Linux kernel documentation.

    # new 'io' properties for tracking tty output
    - name: io
      level: extended
      type: object
      short: A chunk of input or output (IO) from a single process.

        A chunk of input or output (IO) from a single process.

        This field only appears on the top level process object, which is the process that wrote the output or read the input.

    - name: io.type
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The type of object on which the IO action (read or write) was taken.
      description: >
        The type of object on which the IO action (read or write) was taken.

        Currently only 'tty' is supported. Other types may be added in the future for 'file' and 'socket' support.

    - name: io.text
      level: extended
      type: wildcard
      short: A chunk of output or input sanitized to UTF-8.

        Best efforts are made to ensure complete lines are captured in these events. Assumptions should NOT be made that multiple lines will appear in the same event. TTY output may contain terminal control codes such as for cursor movement, so some string queries may not match due to terminal codes inserted between characters of a word.

    # future addition (NOT TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS RFC)
    - name: io.bytes
      level: extended
      type: binary
      description: >
        A base64 encoded string of binary data read or written by a process. It's preferable to use process.io.text instead, where possible, to improve searchability.
