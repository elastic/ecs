    - name: tty.char_device.major
      description: >
        The major number identifies the driver associated with the device. The character device's major and minor numbers can be algorithmically combined to produce the more familiar terminal identifiers such as "ttyS0" and "pts/0". For more details, please refer to the Linux kernel documentation.

        Fields describing a batch of input or output (IO) data produced by a process.

        These fields should only appear on the top level process object when event.action is 'io'

    - name: io.source
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Source of the process IO
      description: >
         Source of the process IO

         e.g tty

    - name: io.data
      level: extended
      type: object
      description: >
        A time ordered array of objects containing process input/output chunks encoded as UTF-8.

        For 'tty' sources, each entry in the array is a "best effort" line of TTY output. Note: Not all entries will be complete lines due to batching and timeout constraints.
      normalize: array

    - name: io.data.raw
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: A chunk of raw process IO encoded as UTF-8
      description: >
        A chunk of raw process IO encoded as UTF-8

        Output is captured raw, and so can contain escaped terminal control codes. ASCII formatting and color escape codes can cause unexpected characters to appear between words, so care should be taken when writing rules or filters against process.io.data.raw.
