  title: Agent
  group: 2
  short: Fields about the monitoring agent.
  description: >
    The agent fields contain the data about the software entity, if any, that collects, detects, or observes events on a host, or takes measurements on a host.

    Examples include Beats. Agents may also run on observers. ECS agent.* fields shall be populated with details of the agent running on the host or observer where the event happened or the measurement was taken.
  footnote: >
    Examples: In the case of Beats for logs, the agent.name is filebeat. For APM, it is the
    agent running in the app/service. The agent information does not change if
    data is sent through queuing systems like Kafka, Redis, or processing systems
    such as Logstash or APM Server.
