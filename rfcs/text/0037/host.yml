### Overview ###
# 
# The following metrics give an overview on the current state of a host. On a high level it collects
# the following data:
#
# * CPU used (in %) and load
# * Memory used (in %, used, total)
# * Disk usage (in %)  and io -> summary
# * Network (traffic in / out)
#
# This translates to the detailed metric list below.


### CPU ###

# The CPU metrics must indicate under how much load the system is. 
#
# The two metrics collected are normalized percentage of system and user CPU usage. 
# Normalised means to 100% even if there are multiple cores.
#
# Idle can be calculated based on the delivered values if needed.

- name: host.cpu.system.norm.pct
  type: double
  # Support this requires an Elasticsearch version on 8.6 or newer
  time_series_metric: gauge
  description: >
    The normalised percentage of CPU time spent in kernel space.

- name: host.cpu.user.norm.pct
  type: double
  time_series_metric: gauge
  description: >
    The normalised percentage of CPU time spent in user space.

### Disk io ###

# Disk io metrics describe the disk operations.
# 
# These are overall metrics applying to all disks of a host.
# 
# Existing `host.disk.read.bytes` and `host.disk.write.bytes` values 
# [from ECS](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-host.html)  were skipped here in purpose.
#
# TODO: Other potential metrics:
# * CPU time spent in IO wait to be able to tell when you are waiting on the disk or some other IO device.


- name: host.diskio.io.ops
  type: long
  time_series_metric: gauge
  description: >
    The total number of I/Os in progress.

- name: host.diskio.io.time
  type: long
  time_series_metric: gauge
  description: >
    The total number of of milliseconds spent doing I/Os.


### File system stats ###

# The file system metrics indicate how full the disks are.
# 
# If there are multiple file systems, this is a summary of all the file systems.

  # TODO: Discuss if it should be `fsstat` or `fsstats` (plural)
- name: host.fsstats.total_size.used
  type: long
  format: bytes
  time_series_metric: gauge
  description: >
    Total disk space used in bytes.

- name: host.fsstats.total_size.total
  type: long
  format: bytes
  time_series_metric: gauge
  description: >
    Total size of disks in bytes.

  # TODO: Name discussion needed as `.pct` would conflict with keyword / object
  # In case `subobject: false` is used, this would work.
- name: host.fsstats.total_size.used.pct
  type: long
  format: bytes
  time_series_metric: gauge
  description: >
    Percentage of disk space used.



### Load ###

# These are the normalised load metrics for a host.
# 
# The values are normalised by the number of cores available on the machine. If 4 cores are available, the values are devided by 4.
#
# These metrics might not be available on windows.
#
# Same metrics with a system.* prefix are collected by metricbeat: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/metricbeat-metricset-system-load.html
#
# DISCUSS: what should we do with these values around windows?

- name: host.load.norm.1
  type: double
  # Support this requires an Elasticsearch version on 8.6 or newer
  time_series_metric: gauge
  description: >
    Load on the host for the last minute divided by the number of cores.

- name: host.load.norm.5
  type: double
  time_series_metric: gauge
  description: >
    Load on the host for the five minutes divided by the number of cores.

- name: host.load.norm.15
  type: double
  time_series_metric: gauge
  description: >
    Load on the host for the fifteen minutes divided by the number of cores.


### Memory ###

# Memory metrics for the host
#
# Same metrics with a system.* prefix are collected by metricbeat: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/metricbeat-metricset-system-memory.html

  # TODO: There seems to be some ambiguity around this metric?
- name: host.memory.actual.used.bytes
  type: long
  time_series_metric: gauge
  description: >
    Actual used memory in bytes. It represents the difference between the total and the available memory. 
    The available memory depends on the OS.

- name: host.memory.actual.used.pct
  type: double
  time_series_metric: gauge
  description: >
    The percentage of actual used memory.

- name: host.memory.total
  type: long
  time_series_metric: gauge
  description: >
    Total memory available on the host machine.


### Network ###

# Network egress and ingress metrics.
#
# The following are 2 existing ECS metrics found under https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-host.html

- name: host.network.egress.bytes
  type: long
  level: extended
  short: The number of bytes sent on all network interfaces of a host.
  time_series_metric: gauge # This part is new
  description: >
    The number of bytes (gauge) sent out on all network interfaces by the
    host since the last metric collection.

- name: host.network.egress.packets
  type: long
  level: extended
  time_series_metric: gauge # This part is new
  short: The number of packets sent on all network interfaces of a host.
  description: >
    The number of packets (gauge) sent out on all network interfaces by the
    host since the last metric collection.
