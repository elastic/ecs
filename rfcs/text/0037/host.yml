    Normalised system cpu usage of a host.

# These are the normalised load metrics for a host.

# The values are normalised by the number of cores available on the machine. If 4 cores are available, the values are devided by 4.
#
# These metrics might not be available on windows.

# Same metrics with a system.* prefix are collected by metricbeat: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/metricbeat-metricset-system-load.html
