### Load ###

# These are the normalised load metrics for a host.
# 
# The values are normalised by the number of cores available on the machine. If 4 cores are available, the values are devided by 4.
#
# These metrics might not be available on windows.
#
# Same metrics with a system.* prefix are collected by metricbeat: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/metricbeat-metricset-system-load.html

- name: host.load.norm.1
  type: double
  # Support this requires an Elasticsearch version on 8.6 or newer
  time_series_metric: gauge
  description: >
    Load on the host for the last minute divided by the number of cores.

- name: host.load.norm.5
  type: double
  time_series_metric: gauge
  description: >
    Load on the host for the five minutes divided by the number of cores.

- name: host.load.norm.15
  type: double
  time_series_metric: gauge
  description: >
    Load on the host for the fifteen minutes divided by the number of cores.


### Memory ###

# Memory metrics for the host
#
# Same metrics with a system.* prefix are collected by metricbeat: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/metricbeat-metricset-system-memory.html

  # TODO: There seems to be some ambiguity around this metric?
- name: host.memory.actual.used.bytes
  type: long
  time_series_metric: gauge
  description: >
    Actual used memory in bytes. It represents the difference between the total and the available memory. 
    The available memory depends on the OS.

- name: host.memory.actual.used.pct
  type: double
  time_series_metric: gauge
  description: >
    The percentage of actual used memory.

- name: host.memory.total
  type: long
  time_series_metric: gauge
  description: >
    Total memory available on the host machine.


### Network ###

# Network egress and ingress metrics.
#
# The following are 2 existing ECS metrics found under https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-host.html

- name: host.network.egress.bytes
  type: long
  level: extended
  short: The number of bytes sent on all network interfaces of a host.
  time_series_metric: gauge # This part is new
  description: >
    The number of bytes (gauge) sent out on all network interfaces by the
    host since the last metric collection.

- name: host.network.egress.packets
  type: long
  level: extended
  time_series_metric: gauge # This part is new
  short: The number of packets sent on all network interfaces of a host.
  description: >
    The number of packets (gauge) sent out on all network interfaces by the
    host since the last metric collection.
