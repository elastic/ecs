# 0017: Remove log.original

- Stage: **3 (finished)** <!-- Update to reflect target stage. See https://elastic.github.io/ecs/stages.html -->
- Date: **2021-06-23** <!-- The ECS team sets this date at merge time. This is the date of the latest stage advancement. -->

This RFC supersedes issue [#841](https://github.com/elastic/ecs/issues/841) which implies breaking changes therefore the RFC Process is indicated.

The request is to consolidate `log.original` and `event.original` by removing `log.original`, since these are almost equivalent in nature. (One) justification for preserving `event.original` is that not all events are logs. Once `log.original` is removed, `event.original` will be the sole field intended to capture the original untouched event.

## Fields

| Field Set | Field(s) |
| --------- | -------- |
| [`log`](0017/log.yml) | `log.original` |
| [`event`](0017/event.yml) | `event.original` |

- The internal description of the field `log.original` in [`log`](0017/log.yml) should be amended by addition of a notice of deprecation and subsequently removal if/when Deprecation progresses to Removal

- The internal description of the field `event.original` in [`event`](0017/event.yml) should be updated to reflect the revised scope 

- The extended description of `log.original` in the [`Log Fields documentation`](https://github.com/elastic/ecs/blob/master/docs/field-details.asciidoc#field-log-original) should be amended by addition of a notice of deprecation and subsequently removal if/when Deprecation progresses to Removal

- The extended description of `event.original` in the [`Event Fields documentation`](https://github.com/elastic/ecs/blob/master/docs/field-details.asciidoc#field-event-original) should be amended to clarify the absorption of `log.original`

 
## Usage

The following examples are taken verbatim from the existing field definitions 
and are included for completeness.

These are the raw texts of entire events, for example a log message. They 
differ from the extracted `message` field in that no processing has been 
applied and the field is not indexed by default. The field can still be 
retrieved from `_source` and is well-suited to demonstration of log integrity
or in a re-index pipeline. 

## Source data

Any or all incoming log or event messages when the original value of the event needs to be preserved.

```
{"event.original": "Sep 19 08:26:10 host CEF:0&#124;Security&#124;
          threatmanager&#124;1.0&#124;100&#124;
          worm successfully stopped&#124;10&#124;src=10.0.0.1
          dst=2.1.2.2spt=1232"}

{"event.original": "Sep 19 08:26:10 localhost My log"}

{
    "event": {
        "original": "{\"Node\":\"compute01-hc-xx-local-abcdefgh-com\",\"CheckID\":\"_nomad-check-2724899cc463354bb6336c67421b73f36fb966e2\",\"Name\":\"service: \\\"hello-world\\\" check\",\"Status\":\"passing\",\"Notes\":\"\",\"Output\":\"HTTP GET http://10.100.8.99:8080/: 200 OK Output: Hello world!

}
```

## Scope of impact

Beats modules, Agent integration packages and the Logging UI would be required to migrate if this change is adopted as proposed.

The removal of `log.original` will be considered a breaking change since the field is being removed from the schema. Possible migration/mitigations for users impacted may include:

- The [`Beats default fields inclusion list`](https://github.com/elastic/ecs/blob/master/scripts/generators/beats_default_fields_allowlist.yml) list should be updated by removing `log.original` if/when Deprecation progresses to Removal

- The logs UI `message` column currently displays `log.original` in the absence of a `message` field. It should be updated to use `event.original` as the substitute field. See [builtin_rules](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/infra/server/services/log_entries/message/builtin_rules/generic.ts) and [associated test](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/infra/server/services/log_entries/message/builtin_rules/generic.test.ts). Kibana team is aware and has a [PR awaiting review](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/102236) which addresses this.

- The breakdown of usage of this field in Kibana source shows:
  - 88 usages in tests
  - 22 usages outside of tests, e.g. `js`, `ts`, `map` files

- For example, references in the [RAC Rule Registry](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/rule_registry/common/assets/field_maps/ecs_field_map.ts) will need to be removed - these have `required: false` so hopefully non-breaking change.

- Multiple tests in Kibana will need to be updated see e.g. [Function Test APM Mapping](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/test/functional/es_archives/monitoring/setup/collection/detect_apm/mappings.json)

- TBD would it be beneficial to alias `log.original` for current users of this field

- TBD if there exist current users of fields with distinct content/meaning in a common index mapping

## Concerns

As a breaking change, this would require timely communication to the Elastic Community.

With respect to internal stakeholders, the following actons have been taken:

- Reached out the Beats + Integrations teams: Filebeat has already taken action, thanks @P1llus

- Reached out to Logs UI team: `logs.original` has now been superceed by `event.original` as fallback when `message`not available, thanks @weltenwort

- Reached out to RAC: the reference [RAC Rule Registry](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/rule_registry/common/assets/field_maps/ecs_field_map.ts) has been acknowledged, thanks @jasonrhodes
