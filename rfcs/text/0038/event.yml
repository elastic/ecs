            This value indicates events whose primary purpose is to store an inventory of
            assets/entities and their attributes. Assets/entities are objects (such as
            users and hosts) that are expected to be subjects of detailed analysis within
            the system.

            Examples include lists of user identities or accounts ingested from directory
            services such as Active Directory (AD), inventory of hosts pulled from
            configuration management databases (CMDB), and lists of cloud storage buckets
            pulled from cloud provider API's.

            This value is used by Elastic Security for asset management solutions.
            `event.kind: asset` is not used for normal system events or logs that are coming
            from an asset/entity, nor is it used for system events or logs coming from a
            directory or CMDB system.
