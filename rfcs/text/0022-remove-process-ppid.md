The `process.ppid` field has been part of ECS since 1.0.0. The `process.parent.*` fields were later introduced in ECS 1.3.0, including `process.parent.pid`. Both fields serve the same purpose: capture the process identifier (PID) of a process' parent.

There's no need to have two fields to capture the same value. ECS now includes all parent process fields under the `process.parent.*` nesting, and `process.ppid` should be deprecated and later removed.

## Fields

Removing `process.ppid` will take place in two steps:

1. ECS `1.x`: Indicate that `process.ppid` is deprecated in the fields description in an upcoming ECS minor release. Producers and consumers of `process.ppid` should use `process.parent.pid` instead.
2. Later remove `process.ppid` field as a breaking change.

Removing `process.ppid` will also eliminate `process.parent.ppid`.

## Usage

New processes are typically spawned directly from their parent, or calling, process. Capturing the parent PID (PPID) has many applications:

* Modeling process hierarchy
* Attackers may try to start a process with an arbitrary parent process set. Capturing the PPID value helps identify if an attacker is attempting privilege escalation through PPID spoofing.
* Collecting PPID as a possible data point to help with the observability of a system.

Users will still be able to capture the PPID in the `process.parent.pid` field. Having the single field available should help improve the experience for anyone trying to capture and query PPIDs from their events.

## Source data

The `process.ppid` is populated across several data sources:

* APM Server and agents
* Beats modules
* Beats `add_process_metadata` processor
* Elastic agent integration packages

An example of how `process.ppid` is populated:

```json
{
    "@timestamp": "2016-12-07T02:16:24.827Z",
    "process": {
        "executable": "/usr/bin/kmod",
        "exit_code": 0,
        "name": "modprobe",
        "pid": 391,
        "ppid": 390,
    },
    "service": {
        "type": "auditd",
    }
}
```

Now the mapping for above document would be updated to use `process.parent.pid` instead:

```json
{
    "@timestamp": "2016-12-07T02:16:24.827Z",
    "process": {
        "executable": "/usr/bin/kmod",
        "exit_code": 0,
        "name": "modprobe",
        "pid": 391,
        "parent": {
            "pid": 390
        }
    },
    "service": {
        "type": "auditd",
    }
}
```

## Scope of impact

### Ingestion mechanisms

APM, Beats, Elastic Agent, and any processors that populate `process.ppid` today will need to be identified and a migration plan to `process.parent.pid` established.

### Usage mechanisms

The security detection rules [repo](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules) will need audited. Any usage of `process.ppid` should ideally migrate to `process.parent.pid`, but backward compatibility also remains essential.

### ECS

The field will be marked as deprecated in an upcoming ECS `1.x` release in the ECS documentation and be removed entirely from ECS and the docs in the `8.0` release.

## Concerns

### Data producers populating `process.ppid`

The `process.ppid` is populated in many data producers, so migrating to `process.parent.pid` will take coordination when `process.ppid` is removed.

**Resolution**: Field aliases might be of some use to alleviate some pain during the migration for any aggregations or visualizations relying on `process.ppid`:

```
PUT rfc_0018/_mapping
{
  "properties": {
    "process": {
      "properties": {
        "ppid": {
          "type": "alias",
          "path": "process.parent.pid"
        },
        "parent": {
          "properties": {
            "pid": {
              "type": "long"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Removing `process.parent.ppid`

Removing `process.ppid` will also remove its reuse in `process.parent`: `process.parent.ppid` (parent's parent PID). This will leave ECS without an equivalent, replacement field.

**Resolution**: [Discussed](https://github.com/elastic/ecs/pull/1450#issuecomment-854773783) with Protections, Endpoint, and Observability stakeholders. Not having a replacement field for the parent's parent PID didn't raise significant concerns.
