    These fields are in beta and are subject to change.
  description: >
    Fields for describing risk score and risk level of entities such as hosts and users.
    These fields are not allowed to be nested under `event.*`. Please continue to use
    `event.risk_score` and `event.risk_score_norm` for event risk.
  reusable:
