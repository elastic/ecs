  title: Function as a Service
  group: 2
  short: Fields for function as a service executions.
  description: >
    Fields related to serverless execution contexts and invocations of 
    function as a service resources such as AWS Lambda, Azure functions, 
    Google Cloud Functions, etc.
  type: group
  fields:
    - name: execution
      level: extended
      example: af9d5aa4-a685-4c5f-a22b-444f80b3cc28
      type: keyword
      short: The execution ID.
      description: >
        Uniquely identifies an invocation of a serverless function.
    - name: trigger.type
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The type of the trigger a function invoction is resulting from. 
      description: >
        Serverless functions can be triggered through different types of upstream services, 
        such as API gateways, message queues, change events on storage files, etc.
        This field specifies the type of the trigger.
      example: http
      allowed_values:
        - name: http
          description: >
            This value indicates a function invocation triggered through an HTTP request.
            For example, on AWS, `trigger.type` is set to the value `http` if an API Gateway 
            triggers a Lambda function.
        - name: pubsub
          description: >
            This value indicates a function invocation triggered through a message being received.
            For example, on AWS, `trigger.type` is set to the value `pubsub` if a Lambda function 
            is triggered by an SQS or an SNS message.
        - name: datasource
          description: >
            This value indicates a function invocation triggered by an event that results from a 
            change on a datasource.
            For example, on AWS, `trigger.type` is set to the value `datasource` if a Lambda function 
            is triggered by a change on a S3 bucket or file.
        - name: timer
          description: >
            This value indicates a scheduled function invocation.
            For example, on AWS, `trigger.type` is set to the value `timer` if a Lambda function 
            is triggered by a scheduled CloudWatch event.
        - name: other
          description: >
            This value is used if a function invocation does not fit into any of the explicit 
            `trigger.type` categories.
    - name: trigger.request_id
      level: extended
      example: zf7d5cb3-a685-4c5f-a22b-745f80b3dx49
      type: keyword
      description: >
        The unique request ID of the trigger event for a function invocation.
    - name: coldstart
      level: extended
      type: boolean
      example: true
      short: Indicates a cold start of a function.
      description: >
        Boolean value indicating a cold start of a function invocation.
        A function invocation leads to a cold start if the serverless 
        runtime needs to be created and started before the actual request can be handled.
        Requests that hit active serverless runtimes do not suffer from a cold start.
