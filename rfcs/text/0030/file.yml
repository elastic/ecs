      short: The minor block device number.
      description: >
        The minor number is used only by the driver specified by the major number; other parts of the kernel donâ€™t use it, and merely pass it along to the driver. It is common for a driver to control several devices; the minor number provides a way for the driver to differentiate among them.
      example: 128
