    These fields contain information about a file descriptor.

    In Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems, a file descriptor (FD, less frequently fildes) is a unique identifier (handle) for a file or other input/output resource, such as a pipe or network socket.
  type: group
  reusable:
    top_level: false
    expected:
      - at: process
        as: tty
        short_override: The file descriptor for the controlling tty (ctty).

  fields:
    - name: type
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The type of file descriptor.
      description: >
        The type of file descriptor.

        One of: file, char_device, pipe, fifo, socket, epoll, signal, inotify, bpf, event, perf_event, timer, userfault, namespace, io_uring
      example: char_device

    - name: descriptor
      level: extended
      type: short
      short: The integer representation of the FD.
      description: >
        File descriptors typically have non-negative integer values, with negative values being reserved to indicate "no value" or error conditions.

        File descriptors are a part of the POSIX API. Each Unix process (except perhaps daemons) should have three standard POSIX file descriptors, corresponding to the three standard streams: 0 - Standard input (stdin), 1 - Standard output (stdout), 2 - Standard error (stderr).

      example: 1

    - name: char_device
      level: extended
      type: object
      short: Character device major and minor numbers.
      description: >
        A Character ('c') Device is one with which the Driver communicates by sending and receiving single characters (bytes, octets).

        Examples for Character Devices: serial ports, parallel ports, sounds cards.

        This field is only populated if fd.type: char_device

    - name: char_device.major
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: The major character device number.
      description: >
        The major number identifies the driver associated with the device.
      example: 1

    - name: char_device.minor
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: The minor character device number.
      description: >
        The minor number is used only by the driver specified by the major number; other parts of the kernel don’t use it, and merely pass it along to the driver. It is common for a driver to control several devices; the minor number provides a way for the driver to differentiate among them.
      example: 128

    - name: file.block_device
      level: extended
      type: object
      short: Block device information on the file.
      description: >
        Block device information on the file.

    - name: file.block_device.major
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: The major block device number.
      description: >
        The major number identifies the driver associated with the device.
      example: 1

    - name: file.block_device.minor
      level: extended

      description: >
        The integer representation of the socket domain. For unix domain sockets the value is 1 (AF_UNIX see sys/socket.h). TCP and UDP sockets will have a value of 2 (AF_INET)
