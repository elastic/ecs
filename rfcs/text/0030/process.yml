        Whether the process is connected to an interactive shell.

        Process interactivity is infered from the processes file descriptors. If the character device for the controlling tty is the same as stdin and stderr for the process, the process is considered interactive.

        Note: A non-interactive process can belong to an interactive session and is simply one that does not have open file descriptors reading the controlling TTY on FD 0 (stdin) or writing to the controlling TTY on FD 2 (stderr). A backgrounded process is still considered interactive if stdin and stderr are connected to the controlling TTY.
