      short: Percent CPU used, between 0 and 1.
      description: >
        Percent CPU used which is normalized by the number of CPU cores and it
        ranges from 0 to 1. Scaling factor: 1000.

        For example: For a two core host, this value should be the average of the
        two cores, between 0 and 1.
