# Concrete usage example

This directory contains a full example of using the ECS tools to manage your
project's index template (or your Beats field definitions) with the ECS tools.

The `fields` directory contains files managed by the sample project, whereas
the `generated` directory contains the files generated by running the following
command from the root of the ECS repository:

```bash
python scripts/generator.py --ref v1.6.0 \
  --subset            usage-example/fields/subset.yml \
  --include           usage-example/fields/custom/ \
  --out               usage-example/ \
  --template-settings-v1 ../my-project/fields/template-settings-v1.json \
  --template-settings-v2 ../my-project/fields/template-settings-v2.json \
  --mapping-settings  usage-example/fields/mapping-settings.json
```

Refer back to [USAGE.md](../USAGE.md) for the documentation on each of these flags.
