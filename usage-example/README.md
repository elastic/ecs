# Concrete usage example

This directory contains a full example of using the ECS tools to manage your
project's index template (or your Beats field definitions) with the ECS tools.

The `fields` directory contains files managed by the sample project, whereas
the `generated` directory contains the files generated by running the following
command from the root of the ECS repository:

```bash
python scripts/generator.py --ref v8.0.0 \
  --subset                   usage-example/fields/subset.yml \
  --include                  usage-example/fields/custom/ \
  --out                      usage-example/ \
  --template-settings-legacy usage-example/fields/template-settings-legacy.json \
  --template-settings        usage-example/fields/template-settings.json \
  --mapping-settings         usage-example/fields/mapping-settings.json
```
