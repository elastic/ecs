  title: Base
  group: 1
  short: All fields defined directly at the root of the events.
  description: >
    The `base` field set contains all fields which are at the root of the events.
    These fields are common across all types of events.
  type: group
  fields:
    - name: "@timestamp"
      type: date
      level: core
      required: true
      example: "2016-05-23T08:05:34.853Z"
      short: Date/time when the event originated.
      description: >
        Date/time when the event originated.

        This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing
        when the event was generated by the source.

        If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically
        populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.

        Required field for all events.

        - relation: otlp
          otlp_field: start_time_unix_nano
          note: >
            On logs, events and metrics, `time_unix_nano` defines the time of the event.
            For logs, `observed_time_unix_nano` defines the time when the event was observed by the collection system.
            On spans, `start_time_unix_nano` represents the start time of the span.

      example: "{\"application\": \"foo-bar\", \"env\": \"production\"}"
      short: Custom key/value pairs.
      description: >
        Custom key/value pairs.

        Can be used to add meta information to events. Should not contain nested
        objects. All values are stored as keyword.

        Example: `docker` and `k8s` labels.
      otel:
        - relation: related
          attribute: k8s.pod.label
        - relation: related
          attribute: container.label

    - name: message
      level: core
      type: match_only_text
      example: "Hello World"
      short: Log message optimized for viewing in a log viewer.
      description: >
        For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for
        viewing in a log viewer.

        For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can
        be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.

        If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.
      otel:
        - relation: otlp
          otlp_field: body
          stability: stable
          note: The `body` in OTLP is of type `Any` and can be either an unstructured log message or a structured event.
