  title: Base
  group: 1
  short: All fields defined directly at the top level
  description: >
    The base set contains all fields which are on the top level. These fields are common across all types of events.
  type: group
  fields:
    - name: "@timestamp"
      type: date
      level: core
      required: true
      example: "2016-05-23T08:05:34.853Z"
      short: Date/time when the event originated.
      description: >
        Date/time when the event originated.

        For log events this is the date/time when the event was generated, and
        not when it was read.

        Required field for all events.

    - name: tags
      level: core
      type: keyword
      example: "[\"production\", \"env2\"]"
      description: >
        List of keywords used to tag each event.

    - name: labels
      level: core
      type: object
      object_type: keyword
      example: {env: production, application: foo-bar}
      short: Custom key/value pairs.
      description: >
        Custom key/value pairs.

        Can be used to add meta information to events. Should not contain nested
        objects. All values are stored as keyword.

        Example: `docker` and `k8s` labels.

    - name: message
      level: core
      type: text
      example: "Hello World"
      short: Log message optimized for viewing in a log viewer.
      description: >
        For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for
        viewing in a log viewer.

        For structured logs without an original message field, other field can
        be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.

        If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.
