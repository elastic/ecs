  title: Event
  group: 2
  short: Fields breaking down the event details.
  description: >
    The event fields are used for context information about the log or metric event itself.

    A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened.
    Log events must include the time at which the thing happened.
    Examples of log events include a process starting on a host,
    a network packet being sent from a source to a destination,
    or a network connection between a client and a server being initiated or closed.
    A metric is defined as an event containing one or more numerical or
    categorical measurements and the time at which the measurement was taken.
    Examples of metric events include memory pressure measured on a host,
    or vulnerabilities measured on a scanned host.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: id
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Unique ID to describe the event.
      example: 8a4f500d

    - name: code
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Identification code for this event.
      description: >
        Identification code for this event, if one exists.

        Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously,
        regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time.
        An example of this is the Windows Event ID.
      example: 4648

    - name: kind
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: The kind of the event. The highest categorization field in the hierarchy.
      description: >
        This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the
        highest level in the ECS category hierarchy.

        `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the
        event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event.
        For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from
        metric events.

        The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled.
        They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also
        help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not.
      example: alert
      allowed_values:
        - name: alert
          description: >
            This value indicates an event that describes an alert or notable event,
            triggered by a detection rule.

            `event.kind:alert` is often populated for events coming from firewalls,
            intrusion detection systems, endpoint detection and response systems, and so on.
        - name: event
          description: >
            This value is the most general and most common value for this field.
            It is used to represent events that indicate that something happened.
        - name: metric
          description: >
            This value is used to indicate that this event that a numeric measurement
            was taken at given point in time.

            Examples include CPU utilization, memory usage, or a vulnerability scan result.

            Metric events are often collected on a predictable frequency, such as once
            every few seconds, or once a minute.
        - name: state
          description: >
            This value is similar to metric, except that the entity being measured does not
            provide a numeric metric value, but rather one of a fixed set of conditions or states.
            For example a periodic event reporting a "fin_wait" state of a TCP connection
            on a host might use `event.type:state`.
        - name: pipeline_error
          description: >
            This value indicates that an error occurred during the ingestion of this event,
            and that event data may be missing, inconsistent, or incorrect.
            `event.kind:pipeline_error` is often associated with parsing errors.
        - name: signal
          description: >
            This value is used by the Elastic SIEM app to denote an Elasticsearch
            document that was created by a SIEM detection engine rule.

            A signal will typically trigger a notification that something
            meaningful happened and should be investigated.

            Usage of this value is reserved, and pipelines should not populate
            `event.kind` with the value "signal".

    - name: category
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Event category. The second categorization field in the hierarchy.
      description: >
        This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the
        second level in the ECS category hierarchy.

        `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example,
        filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity.
        This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory.

        This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events
        that fall in multiple categories.
      example: authentication
      allowed_values:
        - name: authentication
          description: >
            Events in this category are related to the challenge and response process
            in which credentials are supplied and verified to allow the creation of a session.
            Common sources for these logs are Windows event logs and ssh logs.
            Visualize and analyze events in this category to look for failed logins,
            and other authentication-related activity.

          description: >
            The database category denotes events and metrics relating to a data storage
            and retrieval system. Note that use of this category is not limited to
            relational database systems. Examples include event logs from MS SQL, MySQL,
            Elasticsearch, MongoDB, etc. Use this category to visualize and analyze
            database activity such as accesses and changes.
          expected_event_types:
            - access
            - change

            - error
        - name: driver
          description: >
            Events in the driver category have to do with operating system device drivers
            and similar software entities such as Windows drivers, kernel extensions, kernel modules, etc.

            Use events and metrics in this category to visualize and analyze driver-related
            activity and status on hosts.

        - name: file
          description: >
            Relating to a set of information that has been created on, or has existed on a filesystem.
            Use this category of events to visualize and analyze the creation, access,
            and deletions of files. Events in this category can come
            from both host-based and network-based sources. An example source of a network-based
            detection of a file transfer would be the Zeek file.log.

        - name: host
          description: >
            Use this category to visualize and analyze information such as host inventory
            or host lifecycle events.

            Most of the events in this category can usually be observed from the outside,
            such as from a hypervisor or a control plane's point of view. Some can also
            be seen from within, such as "start" or "end".

            Note that this category is for information about hosts themselves;
            it is not meant to capture activity "happening on a host".

            Symantec Endpoint Protection, Crowdstrike, and network IDS/IPS systems
            such as Suricata, or other sources of malware-related events such as
            Palo Alto Networks threat logs and Wildfire logs.
          expected_event_types:
            - info
        - name: package
          description: >
            Relating to software packages installed on hosts. Use this category to
            visualize and analyze inventory of software installed on various hosts,
            or to determine host vulnerability in the absence of vulnerability scan data.

          description: >
            Relating to web server access. Use this category to create a dashboard of
            web server/proxy activity from apache, IIS, nginx web servers, etc.
            Note: events from network observers such as Zeek http log may also be included
            in this category.
          expected_event_types:
            - access

            - info

    - name: action
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: The action captured by the event.
      description: >
        The action captured by the event.

        This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than
        `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`,
        `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer.
      example: user-password-change

    - name: outcome
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: The outcome of the event. The lowest categorization field in the hierarchy.
      description: >
        This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the
        lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy.

        `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represent a success or a failure.
        Note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is
        generally not populated for metric events or events with `event.type:info`.
      example: success
      allowed_values:
        - name: failure
          description: >
            Indicates that this event describes a failed result. A common example is
            `event.category:file AND event.type:access AND event.outcome:failure`
            to indicate that a file access was attempted, but was not successful.
        - name: success
          description: >
            Indicates that this event describes a successful result.  A common example is
            `event.category:file AND event.type:create AND event.outcome:success`
            to indicate that a file was successfully created.
        - name: unknown
          description: >
            Indicates that this event describes only an attempt for which the result
            is unknown. For example, if the event contains information only about a
            request in an entity transaction that usually results in a response,
            populating `event.outcome:unknown` is appropriate.

    - name: type
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Event type. The third categorization field in the hierarchy.
      description: >
        This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the
        third level in the ECS category hierarchy.

        `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with
        the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level
        appropriate for single visualization.

        This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events
        that fall in multiple event types.
      allowed_values:
        - name: access
          description: >
            The access event type is used for the subset of events within a category
            that indicate that something was accessed.
            Common examples include `event.category:database AND event.type:access`,
            or `event.category:file AND event.type:access`.
            Note for file access, both directory listings and file opens should be included
            in this subcategory. You can further distinguish access operations using the ECS
            `event.action` field.
        - name: change
          description: >
            The change event type is used for the subset of events within a category
            that indicate that something has changed. If semantics best describe an
            event as modified, then include them in this subcategory.
            Common examples include `event.category:process AND event.type:change`,
            and `event.category:file AND event.type:change`.
            You can further distinguish change operations using the ECS `event.action` field.
        - name: creation
          description: >
            The "creation" event type is used for the subset of events within a category
            that indicate that something was created.
            A common example is `event.category:file AND event.type:creation`.
        - name: deletion
          description: >
            The deletion event type is used for the subset of events within a category
            that indicate that something was deleted.
            A common example is `event.category:file AND event.type:deletion`
            to indicate that a file has been deleted.
        - name: end
          description: >
            The end event type is used for the subset of events within a category
            that indicate something has ended.
            A common example is `event.category:process AND event.type:end`.
        - name: error
          description: >
            The error event type is used for the subset of events within a category
            that indicate or describe an error.
            A common example is `event.category:database AND event.type:error`.
            Note that pipeline errors that occur during the event ingestion process
            should not use this `event.type` value. Instead, they should use
            `event.kind:pipeline_error`.
        - name: info
          description: >
            The info event type is used for the subset of events within a category
            that indicate that they are purely informational, and don't report a state
            change, or any type of action. For example, an initial run of a file integrity
            monitoring system (FIM), where an agent reports all files under management,
            would fall into the "info" subcategory. Similarly, an event containing a
            dump of all currently running processes (as opposed to reporting that a process
            started/ended) would fall into the "info" subcategory.
            An additional common examples is `event.category:intrusion_detection AND event.type:info`.
        - name: installation
          description: >
            The installation event type is used for the subset of events within a category
            that indicate that something was installed.
            A common example is `event.category:package` AND `event.type:installation`.
        - name: start
          description: >
            The start event type is used for the subset of events within a category
            that indicate something has started. A common example is
            `event.category:process AND event.type:start`.

    - name: module
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Name of the module this data is coming from.
      description: >
        Name of the module this data is coming from.

        If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to
        process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs),
        `event.module` should contain the name of this module.
      example: apache

    - name: dataset
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Name of the dataset.
      description: >
        Name of the dataset.

        If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events
        (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which
        one the event comes from.

        It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with
        the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name.
      example: apache.access

    - name: provider
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Source of the event.
      description: >
        Source of the event.

        Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically
        mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the
        software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd),
        or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing).

      example: kernel

    - name: severity
      type: long
      level: core
      format: string
      example: 7
      short: Numeric severity of the event.
      description: >
        The numeric severity of the event according to your event source.

        What the different severity values mean can be different between sources
        and use cases.
        It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across
        events from the same source.

        The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`.
        `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to
        the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS).
        If the event source does not publish its own severity,
        you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`.

    - name: original

      short: Raw text message of entire event.
      description: >
          Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity.

          This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be
          searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`.
      index: false

      type: keyword
      example: "123456789012345678901234567890ABCD"
      description: >
          Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to

      type: long
      format: duration
      input_format: nanoseconds
      output_format: asMilliseconds
      output_precision: 1
      short: Duration of the event in nanoseconds.
      description: >
        Duration of the event in nanoseconds.

        If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the
        difference between the end and start time.

    - name: sequence
      format: string
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: Sequence number of the event.
      description: >
        Sequence number of the event.

        The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the
        exact ordering of events unambiguous, regarless of the timestamp precision.

    - name: timezone
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Event time zone.
      description: >
        This field should be populated when the event's timestamp does not include
        timezone information already (e.g. default Syslog timestamps). It's
        optional otherwise.

        Acceptable timezone formats are: a canonical ID (e.g. "Europe/Amsterdam"),
        abbreviated (e.g. "EST") or an HH:mm differential (e.g. "-05:00").

    - name: created
      level: core
      type: date
      short: Time when the event was first read by an agent or by your pipeline.
      example: 2016-05-23T08:05:34.857Z
      description: >
        event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an
        agent, or by your pipeline.

        This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain
        the time extracted from the original event.

        In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different.
        The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source
        generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it.
        This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to
        keep up with your event source.

        In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used.

    - name: start
      level: extended
      type: date
      description: >
        event.start contains the date when the event started or when the
        activity was first observed.

    - name: end
      level: extended
      type: date
      description: >
        event.end contains the date when the event ended or when the activity
        was last observed.

    - name: risk_score
      level: core
      type: float
      description: >
        Risk score or priority of the event (e.g. security solutions).
        Use your system's original value here.

    - name: risk_score_norm
      level: extended
      type: float
      short: Normalized risk score or priority of the event (0-100).
      description: >
        Normalized risk score or priority of the event, on a scale of 0 to 100.

        This is mainly useful if you use more than one system that assigns
        risk scores, and you want to see a normalized value across all systems.

    - name: ingested
      level: core
      type: date
      short: Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store.
      example: 2016-05-23T08:05:35.101Z
      description: >
        Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store.

        This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally
        occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant
        to capture the first time an agent saw the event.

        In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should
        chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`.
