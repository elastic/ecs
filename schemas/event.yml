    The event fields are used for context information about the data itself.
  fields:
    - name: id
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Unique ID to describe the event.
      example: 8a4f500d
      phase: 1
    - name: category
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Event category.

        This can be a user defined category.
      example: metrics

    - name: type
      type: keyword
      description: >
        A type given to this kind of event which can be used for grouping.

        This is normally defined by the user.
      example: nginx-stats-metrics

    - name: module
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Name of the module this data is coming from.

        This information is coming from the modules used in Beats or Logstash.
      example: mysql

    - name: dataset
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Name of the dataset.

        The concept of a `dataset` (fileset / metricset) is used in Beats as a
        subset of modules. It contains the information which is currently
        stored in metricset.name and metricset.module or fileset.name.
      example: stats

    - name: severity
      type: long
      phase: 1
      example: "7"
      description: >
        Severity describes the severity of the event. What the different
        severity values mean can very different between use cases. It's up to
        the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events.

      example: "Sep 19 08:26:10 host CEF:0&#124;Security&#124;
          threatmanager&#124;1.0&#124;100&#124;

      description: >
          Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity.

          This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be
          searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`.
      index: false
      doc_values: false

    - name: hash
      type: keyword
      phase: 1
      example: "123456789012345678901234567890ABCD"
      description: >
          Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to
          demonstrate log integrity.

    - name: version
      type: keyword
      required: true
      description: >
        The version field contains the version an event for ECS adheres to.

        This field should be provided as part of each event to make it possible
        to detect to which ECS version an event belongs.

        event.version is a required field and must exist in all events. It
        describes which ECS version the event adheres to.

        The current version is 0.1.0.
      example: 0.1.0

    - name: duration
      type: long
      description: >
        Duration of the event in nanoseconds.

    - name: created
      type: date
      description: >
        event.created contains the date when the event was created.

        This timestamp is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp contains
        the processed timestamp. For logs these two timestamps can be different
        as the timestamp in the log line and when the event is read for example
        by Filebeat are not identical. `@timestamp` must contain the timestamp
        extracted from the log line, event.created when the log line is read.
        The same could apply to package capturing where @timestamp contains the
        timestamp extracted from the network package and event.created when the
        event was created.

        In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used.

        Risk score value of the event.
