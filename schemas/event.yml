  description: >
    The event fields are used for context information about the log or metric event itself. A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened. Log events must include the time at which the thing happened. Examples of log events include a process starting on a host, a network packet being sent from a source to a destination, or a network connection between a client and a server being initiated or closed. A metric is defined as an event containing one or more numerical or categorical measurements and the time at which the measurement was taken. Examples of metric events include memory pressure measured on a host, or vulnerabilities measured on a scanned host.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: id
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Unique ID to describe the event.
      example: 8a4f500d

    - name: kind
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        The kind of the event.

        This gives information about what type of information the event
        contains, without being specific to the contents of the event.  Examples
        are `event`, `state`, `alarm`. Warning: In future versions of ECS, we
        plan to provide a list of acceptable values for this field, please use
        with caution.
      example: state

    - name: category
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Event category.

        This contains high-level information about the contents of the event. It
        is more generic than `event.action`, in the sense that typically a
        category contains multiple actions. Warning: In future versions of ECS,
        we plan to provide a list of acceptable values for this field, please
        use with caution.

      example: user-management

    - name: action
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        The action captured by the event.

        This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than
        `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`,
        `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer.
      example: user-password-change

    - name: outcome
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        The outcome of the event.

        If the event describes an action, this fields contains the outcome of
        that action. Examples outcomes are `success` and `failure`. Warning: In
        future versions of ECS, we plan to provide a list of acceptable values
        for this field, please use with caution.

      example: success

        Please avoid using this field for user data.

    - name: module
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Name of the module this data is coming from.

        This information is coming from the modules used in Beats or Logstash.
      example: mysql

    - name: dataset
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Name of the dataset.

        The concept of a `dataset` (fileset / metricset) is used in Beats as a
        subset of modules. It contains the information which is currently
        stored in metricset.name and metricset.module or fileset.name.
      example: stats

    - name: severity
      level: core
      type: long
      example: "7"
      description: >
        Severity describes the severity of the event. What the different
        severity values mean can very different between use cases. It's up to
        the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events.

          Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity.

          This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be
          searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`.
      index: false
      doc_values: false

    - name: hash
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      example: "123456789012345678901234567890ABCD"
      description: >
          Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to
          demonstrate log integrity.

    - name: duration
      level: core
      type: long
      description: >
        Duration of the event in nanoseconds.

        If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the
        difference between the end and start time.

    - name: timezone
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        This field should be populated when the event's timestamp does not include
        timezone information already (e.g. default Syslog timestamps). It's
        optional otherwise.

        Acceptable timezone formats are: a canonical ID (e.g. "Europe/Amsterdam"),
        abbreviated (e.g. "EST") or an HH:mm differential (e.g. "-05:00").

    - name: created
      level: core
      type: date
      description: >
        event.created contains the date when the event was created.

        This timestamp is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp contains
        the processed timestamp. For logs these two timestamps can be different
        as the timestamp in the log line and when the event is read for example
        by Filebeat are not identical. `@timestamp` must contain the timestamp
        extracted from the log line, event.created when the log line is read.
        The same could apply to package capturing where @timestamp contains the
        timestamp extracted from the network package and event.created when the
        event was created.

        In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used.

    - name: start
      level: extended
      type: date
      description: >
        event.start contains the date when the event started or when the
        activity was first observed.

    - name: end
      level: extended
      type: date
      description: >
        event.end contains the date when the event ended or when the activity
        was last observed.

    - name: risk_score
      level: core
      type: float
      description: >
        Risk score or priority of the event (e.g. security solutions).
        Use your system's original value here.

    - name: risk_score_norm
      level: extended
      type: float
      description: >
        Normalized risk score or priority of the event, on a scale of 0 to 100.

        This is mainly useful if you use more than one system that assigns
        risk scores, and you want to see a normalized value across all systems.
