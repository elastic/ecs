- name: url
  title: URL
  short: Fields that let you store URLs in various forms.
  description: >
    URL fields provide support for complete or partial URLs, and supports the
    breaking down into scheme, domain, path, and so on.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: original
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Unmodified original url as seen in the event source.
      description: >
        Unmodified original url as seen in the event source.

        Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL,
        whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path.

        This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete
        or not.
      example: >
        https://www.elastic.co:443/search?q=elasticsearch#top or /search?q=elasticsearch

    - name: full
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Full unparsed URL.
      description: >
        If full URLs are important to your use case, they should be stored in
        `url.full`, whether this field is reconstructed or present in the
        event source.
      example: https://www.elastic.co:443/search?q=elasticsearch#top

    - name: scheme
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Scheme of the url.
      description: >
        Scheme of the request, such as "https".

        Note: The `:` is not part of the scheme.
      example: https

    - name: domain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Domain of the url.
      description: >
        Domain of the url, such as "www.elastic.co".

        In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a
        domain name. In this case, the IP address would go to the `domain` field.
      example: www.elastic.co

    - name: port
      level: extended
      type: long
      description: >
        Port of the request, such as 443.
      example: 443

    - name: path
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Path of the request, such as "/search".

    - name: query
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Query string of the request.
      description: >
        The query field describes the query string of the request,
        such as "q=elasticsearch".

        The `?` is excluded from the query string. If a URL contains
        no `?`, there is no query field. If there is a `?` but no query,
        the query field exists with an empty string. The `exists`
        query can be used to differentiate between the two cases.

    - name: fragment
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Portion of the url after the `#`.
      description: >
        Portion of the url after the `#`, such as "top".

        The `#` is not part of the fragment.

    - name: username
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Username of the request.

    - name: password
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Password of the request.
