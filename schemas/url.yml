    URL fields provide a complete URL, with scheme, host, and path. The URL
    object can be reused in other prefixes, such as `host.url.*` for
    example. Keep the structure consistent whenever you use URL fields.

  fields:
    - name: href
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Full url. The field is stored as keyword.
      
        `url.href` is a [multi field](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/
        elasticsearch/reference/6.2/
        multi-fields.html#_multi_fields_with_multiple_analyzers). The data is
        stored as keyword `url.href` and test
        `url.href.analyzed`. These fields enable you to run a query against part
        of the url still works splitting up the URL at ingest time.  
        
        `href` is an analyzed field so the parsed information can be accessed
        through `href.analyzed` in queries.
        
      multi_fields:
        - name: analyzed
          type: text
      example: https://elastic.co:443/search?q=elasticsearch#top
    - name: scheme
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Scheme of the request, such as "https".

        Note: The `:` is not part of the scheme.
      example: https
    - name: host.name
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Hostname of the request, such as "example.com".

        For correlation the this field can be copied into the `host.name`
        field.
      example: elastic.co
    - name: port
      type: integer
      description: >
        Port of the request, such as 443.
      example: 443
    - name: path
      type: text
      description: >
        Path of the request, such as "/search".
      multi_fields:
        - name: raw
          type: keyword
          description: >
            URL path. A non-analyzed field that is useful
            for aggregations.
    - name: query
      type: text
      description: >
        The query field describes the query string of the request,
        such as "q=elasticsearch".

        The `?` is excluded from the query string. If a URL contains
        no `?`, there is no query field. If there is a `?` but no query,
        the query field exists with an empty string. The `exists`
        query can be used to differentiate between the two cases.
      multi_fields:
        - name: raw
          type: keyword
          description: >
            URL query part. A non-analyzed field that is useful
            for aggregations.
    - name: fragment
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Portion of the url after the `#`, such as "top".

        The `#` is not part of the fragment.
    - name: username
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Username of the request.
    - name: password
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Password of the request.
