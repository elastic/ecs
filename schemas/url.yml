- name: url
  title: URL
  description: >
    URL fields provide a complete URL, with scheme, host, and path. The URL
    object can be reused in other prefixes, such as `host.url.*` for
    example. Keep the structure consistent whenever you use URL fields.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: href
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Full url. The field is stored as keyword.
      example: https://elastic.co:443/search?q=elasticsearch#top

    - name: scheme
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Scheme of the request, such as "https".

        Note: The `:` is not part of the scheme.
      example: https

    - name: domain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Registerable domain of the request (without the subdomain).

      example: elastic.co

    - name: full_domain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Full domain or vhost of the request.

      example: www.elastic.co

    - name: port
      level: extended
      type: integer
      description: >
        Port of the request, such as 443.
      example: 443

    - name: path
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Path of the request, such as "/search".

    - name: query
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        The query field describes the query string of the request,
        such as "q=elasticsearch".

        The `?` is excluded from the query string. If a URL contains
        no `?`, there is no query field. If there is a `?` but no query,
        the query field exists with an empty string. The `exists`
        query can be used to differentiate between the two cases.

    - name: fragment
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Portion of the url after the `#`, such as "top".

        The `#` is not part of the fragment.

    - name: username
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Username of the request.

    - name: password
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Password of the request.
