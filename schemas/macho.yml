        A hash of the Go language imports in a Mach-O file excluding standard library imports.
        An import hash can be used to fingerprint binaries even after recompilation or other
        code-level transformations have occurred, which would change more traditional hash values.

        The algorithm used to calculate the Go symbol hash and a reference implementation
        are available [here](https://github.com/elastic/toutoumomoma).
