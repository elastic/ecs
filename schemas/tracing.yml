    Distributed tracing makes it possible to analyze performance throughout a microservice architecture all in one view.
    This is accomplished by tracing all of the requests - from the initial web request in the front-end service - to queries made through multiple back-end services.

        Unique identifier of the trace.

        A trace groups multiple events like transactions that belong together.
        For example, a user request handled by multiple inter-connected services.

        The `trace.id` allows the distributed trace messages to be correlated across an entire logical operation.

    - name: transaction.id

      short: Unique identifier of the transaction within the scope of its trace.

        Unique identifier of the transaction within the scope of its trace.

        A transaction is the highest level of work measured within a service, such as a request to a server.

    - name: span.id
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      example: 3ff9a8981b7ccd5a
      short: Unique identifier of the span within the scope of its trace.
      description: >
        Unique identifier of the span within the scope of its trace.

        A span represents an operation within a trace, such as a request to another service, or a database query.

        The `span.id` allows messages from a single section of processing within the overall trace, 
        e.g. a request to a component, to be correlated together.
