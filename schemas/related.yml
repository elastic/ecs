    This field set is meant to facilitate pivoting around a piece of data.

    Some pieces of information can be seen in many places in an ECS event.
    To facilitate searching for them, store an array of all seen values to their
    corresponding field in `related.`.

    A concrete example is IP addresses, which can be under host, observer, source,
    destination, client, server, and network.forwarded_ip.
    If you append all IPs to `related.ip`, you can then search for a given IP trivially,
    no matter where it appeared, by querying `related.ip:192.0.2.15`.

  fields:

    - name: ip

        All of the IPs seen on your event.

        - array

    - name: user
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        All the user names or other user identifiers seen on the event.

      normalize:
        - array

        - relation: na

    - name: hash
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: All the hashes seen on your event.
      description: >
        All the hashes seen on your event. Populating this field, then using it
        to search for hashes can help in situations where you're unsure what
        the hash algorithm is (and therefore which key name to search).

      short: All the host identifiers seen on your event.
      description: >
        All hostnames or other host identifiers seen on your event. Example
        identifiers include FQDNs, domain names, workstation names, or aliases.
