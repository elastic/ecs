    This field set is meant to facilitate pivoting around a piece of data.

    Some pieces of information can be seen in many places in an ECS event.
    To facilitate searching for them, store an array of all seen values to their
    corresponding field in `related.`.

    A concrete example is IP addresses, which can be under host, observer, source,
    destination, client, server, and network.forwarded_ip.
    If you append all IPs to `related.ip`, you can then search for a given IP trivially,
    no matter where it appeared, by querying `related.ip:a.b.c.d`.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: ip

        All of the IPs seen on your event.

      type: keyword
      description: >
        All the user names seen on your event.
