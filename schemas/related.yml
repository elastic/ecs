    This field set is meant to facilitate pivoting around a piece of data.

    Some pieces of information can be seen in many places in ECS. To facilitate
    searching for them, append values to their corresponding field in
    `related.`.

    A concrete example is IP addresses, which can be under host, observer, source, destination, client, server, and network.forwarded_ip. If you append all IPs to `related.ip`, you can then search for a given IP trivially, no matter where it appeared, by querying `related.ip:a.b.c.d`.
