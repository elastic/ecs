- name: client
  title: Client
  group: 2
  short: Fields about the client side of a network connection, used with server.
  description: >
    A client is defined as the initiator of a network connection for events regarding sessions, connections, or bidirectional flow records.

    For TCP events, the client is the initiator of the TCP connection that sends the SYN packet(s).
    For other protocols, the client is generally the initiator or requestor in the network transaction.
    Some systems use the term "originator" to refer the client in TCP connections.
    The client fields describe details about the system acting as the client in the network event.
    Client fields are usually populated in conjunction with server fields.
    Client fields are generally not populated for packet-level events.

    Client / server representations can add semantic context to an exchange,
    which is helpful to visualize the data in certain situations.
    If your context falls in that category, you should still ensure that source and destination are filled appropriately.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: address
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Client network address.
      description: >
        Some event client addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will
        sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always
        store the raw address in the `.address` field.

        Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which
        one it is.

    - name: ip
      level: core
      type: ip
      short: IP address of the client.
      description: >

        Can be one or multiple IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

    - name: port
      level: core
      type: long
