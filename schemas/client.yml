- name: client
  title: Client
  group: 2
  short: Fields about the client side of a network connection, used with server.
  description: >
    A client is defined as the initiator of a network connection for events regarding sessions, connections, or bidirectional flow records.

    For TCP events, the client is the initiator of the TCP connection that sends the SYN packet(s).
    For other protocols, the client is generally the initiator or requestor in the network transaction.
    Some systems use the term "originator" to refer the client in TCP connections.
    The client fields describe details about the system acting as the client in the network event.
    Client fields are usually populated in conjunction with server fields.
    Client fields are generally not populated for packet-level events.

    Client / server representations can add semantic context to an exchange,
    which is helpful to visualize the data in certain situations.
    If your context falls in that category, you should still ensure that source and destination are filled appropriately.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: address
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Client network address.
      description: >
        Some event client addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will
        sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always
        store the raw address in the `.address` field.

        Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which
        one it is.

    - name: ip
      level: core
      type: ip
      short: IP address of the client.
      description: >
        IP address of the client (IPv4 or IPv6).

    - name: port
      format: string
      level: core
      type: long
      description: >
        Port of the client.

    - name: mac
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: MAC address of the client.
      example: 00-00-5E-00-53-23
      description: >
        MAC address of the client.

        The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is
        represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of
        the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a
        hyphen.

    - name: domain
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Client domain.

    - name: registered_domain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The highest registered client domain, stripped of the subdomain.
      description: >
        The highest registered client domain, stripped of the subdomain.

        For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com".

        This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public
        suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by
        simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk".
      example: example.com

    - name: top_level_domain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The effective top level domain (com, org, net, co.uk).
      description: >
        The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix,
        is the last part of the domain name.
        For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com".

        This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public
        suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by
        simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk".
      example: co.uk

    - name: subdomain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The subdomain of the domain.
      description: >
        The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all of the names except
        the host name under the registered_domain.  In a partially qualified domain, or if the
        the qualification level of the full name cannot be determined, subdomain contains all of
        the names below the registered domain.

        For example the subdomain portion of "www.east.mydomain.co.uk" is "east".
        If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com",
        the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period.
      example: east
