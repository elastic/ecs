# Entity field set schema definition
- name: entity
  title: Entity
  group: 2
  type: group
  short: Fields to describe various types of entities across IT environments.
  description: >
    The entity fields provide a standardized way to represent and categorize
    different types of components within an IT environment, including those
    that don't have dedicated field sets in ECS. An entity represents a discrete,
    identifiable component that can be described by a set of attributes and
    maintains its identity over time.
  root: false
  reusable:
    top_level: false
    order: 1
    expected:
      - host
      - user
      - cloud
      - service

  fields:
    - name: name
      level: core
      type: keyword
      multi_fields:
        - name: text
          type: text
      short: The name of the entity.
      description: >
        The name of the entity. The keyword field enables exact matches for filtering
        and aggregations, while the text field enables full-text search. For entities with dedicated
        field sets (e.g., `host`), this field should mirrors the corresponding *.name value.
      beta: This field is beta and subject to change.

    - name: id
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Unique identifier for the entity.
      description: >
        A unique identifier for the entity. When multiple identifiers exist, this should be
        the most stable and commonly used identifier that: 1) persists across the entity's
        lifecycle, 2) ensures uniqueness within its scope, 3) is commonly used for queries
        and correlation, and 4) is readily available in most observations (logs/events).
        For entities with dedicated field sets (e.g., host, user), this value should match
        the corresponding *.id field. Alternative identifiers (e.g., ARNs values in AWS, URLs) can be preserved in the raw field.

    - name: source
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Source module or integration that provided the entity data.
      description: >
        The module or integration that provided this entity data (similar to event.module).
      beta: This field is beta and subject to change.

    - name: type
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Standardized high-level classification of the entity.
      description: >
        A standardized high-level classification of the entity. This provides a normalized way
        to group similar entities across different providers or systems. Example values: `bucket`, `database`, `container`, `function`, `queue`, `host`, `user`, `application`, `session`, etc.
      normalize:
        - array
      allowed_values:
        - name: bucket
        - name: database
        - name: container
        - name: function
        - name: queue
        - name: host
        - name: user
        - name: application
        - name: service
        - name: session
      example: host

    - name: sub_type
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The specific type designation for the entity as defined by its provider or system.
      description: >
        The specific type designation for the entity as defined by its provider or system. This field
        provides more granular classification than the type field. Examples: `aws_s3_bucket`, `gcp_cloud_storage_bucket`, `azure_blob_container` would all map to entity type `bucket`.  `hardware` , `virtual` , `container` , `node` , `cloud_instance` would all map to entity type `host'.
      example: aws_s3_bucket
      beta: This field is beta and subject to change.

    - name: display_name
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      multi_fields:
        - name: text
          type: text
      short: An optional field used when a pretty name is desired for entity-centric operations.
      description: >
        An optional field used when a pretty name is desired for entity-centric operations. This field should not be used for correlation with `*.name` fields for entities with dedicated field sets (e.g., `host`).
      beta: This field is beta and subject to change.

    - name: reference
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: A URI, URL, or other direct reference to access or locate the entity.
      description: >
        A URI, URL, or other direct reference to access or locate the entity in its source system.
        This could be an API endpoint, web console URL, or other addressable location. Format may
        vary by entity type and source system.
      beta: This field is beta and subject to change.

    - name: last_seen_timestamp
      level: extended
      type: date
      short: Indicates the date/time when this entity was last "seen."
      description: >
        Indicates the date/time when this entity was last "seen," usually based upon the last event/log that is initiated by this entity.
      beta: This field is beta and subject to change.

    - name: attributes
      level: extended
      type: object
      short: A set of static or semi-static attributes of the entity.
      description: >
        A set of static or semi-static attributes of the entity. Usually boolean or keyword field data types. Use this field set when you need to track static or semi-static characteristics of an entity for advanced searching and correlation of normalized values across different providers/sources and entity types.
      beta: This field is beta and subject to change.

    - name: lifecycle
      level: extended
      type: object
      short: A set of temporal characteristics of the entity.
      description: >
        A set of temporal characteristics of the entity. Usually date field data type. Use this field set when you need to track temporal characteristics of an entity for advanced searching and correlation of normalized values across different providers/sources and entity types.
      beta: This field is beta and subject to change.

    - name: behavior
      level: extended
      type: object
      short: A set of ephemeral characteristics of the entity, derived from observed behaviors during a specific time period.
      description: >
        A set of ephemeral characteristics of the entity, derived from observed behaviors during a specific time period. Usually boolean field data type. Use this field set when you need to capture and track ephemeral characteristics of an entity for advanced searching, correlation of normalized values across different providers/sources and entity types.
      beta: This field is beta and subject to change.

    - name: raw
      level: extended
      type: object
      short: Original, unmodified fields from the source system.
      description: >
        Original, unmodified fields from the source system. Usually flattened field data type. While the attributes field should be used for normalized fields requiring advanced queries, this field preserves all source metadata with basic search capabilities.
      beta: This field is beta and subject to change.

    - name: metrics
      level: extended
      type: object
      short: Field set for any fields containing numeric entity metrics.
      description: >
        Field set for any fields containing numeric entity metrics. These use dynamic field data type mapping.
      beta: This field is beta and subject to change.
