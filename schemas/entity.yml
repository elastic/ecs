# Entity field set schema definition
- name: entity
  title: Entity
  group: 2
  type: group
  short: Fields to describe various types of entities across IT environments.
  description: >
    The entity fields provide a standardized way to represent and categorize
    different types of components within an IT environment, including those
    that don't have dedicated field sets in ECS. An entity represents a discrete,
    identifiable component that can be described by a set of attributes and
    maintains its identity over time.

    expected:
      - user
      - host
      - service
      - at: user
        as: target.entity
        short_override: Entity information for the targeted user.
      - at: cloud
        as: target.entity
        short_override: Entity information for the target cloud entity.
      - at: service
        as: target.entity
        short_override: Entity information for the target service.

  fields:
    - name: name
      level: core
      type: keyword
      multi_fields:
        - name: text
          type: match_only_text
      short: The name of the entity.
      description: >
        The name of the entity. The keyword field enables exact matches for filtering
        and aggregations, while the text field enables full-text search. For entities with dedicated
        field sets (e.g., `host`), this field should mirrors the corresponding *.name value.
      beta: This field is beta and subject to change.

    - name: id
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Unique identifier for the entity.
      description: >
        A unique identifier for the entity. When multiple identifiers exist, this should be
        the most stable and commonly used identifier that: 1) persists across the entity's
        lifecycle, 2) ensures uniqueness within its scope, 3) is commonly used for queries
        and correlation, and 4) is readily available in most observations (logs/events).
        For entities with dedicated field sets (e.g., host, user), this value should match
        the corresponding *.id field. Alternative identifiers (e.g., ARNs values in AWS, URLs) can be preserved in the raw field.

    - name: source
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Source module or integration that provided the entity data.
      description: >
        The module or integration that provided this entity data (similar to event.module).
      beta: This field is beta and subject to change.

    - name: type
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Standardized high-level classification of the entity.
      description: >
        A standardized high-level classification of the entity. This provides a normalized way
        to group similar entities across different providers or systems. Example values: `bucket`, `database`, `container`, `function`, `queue`, `host`, `user`, `application`, `session`, etc.
      normalize:
        - array
      allowed_values:
        - name: bucket
          description: >
            Represents a storage container or bucket, typically used for object storage. Common examples include AWS S3 buckets, Google Cloud Storage buckets, Azure Blob containers, and other cloud storage services. Buckets are used to organize and store files, objects, or data in cloud environments.
        - name: database
          description: >
            Represents a database system or database instance. This includes relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle), NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB), time-series databases, and other data storage systems. The entity may represent the entire database system or a specific database instance.
        - name: container
          description: >
            Represents a containerized application or process. This includes Docker containers, Kubernetes pods, and other containerization technologies. Containers encapsulate applications and their dependencies, providing isolation and portability across different environments.
        - name: function
          description: >
            Represents a serverless function or Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) component. This includes AWS Lambda functions, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, and other serverless computing resources. Functions are typically event-driven and execute code without managing the underlying infrastructure.
        - name: queue
          description: >
            Represents a message queue or messaging system. This includes message brokers, event queues, and other messaging infrastructure components such as Amazon SQS, RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, and Azure Service Bus. Queues facilitate asynchronous communication between applications and services.
        - name: host
          description: >
            Represents a computing host or machine. This includes physical servers, virtual machines, cloud instances, and other computing resources that can run applications or services. Hosts provide the fundamental computing infrastructure for other entity types.
        - name: user
          description: >
            Represents a user account or identity. This includes human users, service accounts, system accounts, and other identity entities that can interact with systems, applications, or services. Users may have various roles, permissions, and attributes associated with their identity.
        - name: application
          description: >
            Represents a software application or service. This includes web applications, mobile applications, desktop applications, and other software components that provide functionality to users or other systems. Applications may run on various infrastructure components and can span multiple hosts or containers.
        - name: service
          description: >
            Represents a service or microservice component. This includes web services, APIs, background services, and other service-oriented architecture components. Services provide specific functionality and may communicate with other services to fulfill business requirements.
        - name: session
          description: >
            Represents a user session or connection session. This includes user login sessions, database connections, network sessions, and other temporary interactive or persistent connections between users, applications, or systems.

    - name: sub_type
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The specific type designation for the entity as defined by its provider or system.
      description: >
        The specific type designation for the entity as defined by its provider or system. This field
        provides more granular classification than the type field. Examples: `aws_s3_bucket`, `gcp_cloud_storage_bucket`, `azure_blob_container` would all map to entity type `bucket`.  `hardware` , `virtual` , `container` , `node` , `cloud_instance` would all map to entity type `host`.
      example: aws_s3_bucket

    - name: display_name
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      multi_fields:
        - name: text
          type: match_only_text
      short: An optional field used when a pretty name is desired for entity-centric operations.
      description: >
        An optional field used when a pretty name is desired for entity-centric operations. This field should not be used for correlation with `*.name` fields for entities with dedicated field sets (e.g., `host`).
      beta: This field is beta and subject to change.

    - name: reference
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: A URI, URL, or other direct reference to access or locate the entity.
      description: >
        A URI, URL, or other direct reference to access or locate the entity in its source system.
        This could be an API endpoint, web console URL, or other addressable location. Format may
        vary by entity type and source system.
      beta: This field is beta and subject to change.

    - name: last_seen_timestamp
      level: extended
      type: date
      short: Indicates the date/time when this entity was last "seen."
      description: >
        Indicates the date/time when this entity was last "seen," usually based upon the last event/log that is initiated by this entity.
      beta: This field is beta and subject to change.

    - name: attributes
      level: extended
      type: object
      short: A set of static or semi-static attributes of the entity.
      description: >
        A set of static or semi-static attributes of the entity. Usually boolean or keyword field data types. Use this field set when you need to track static or semi-static characteristics of an entity for advanced searching and correlation of normalized values across different providers/sources and entity types.
      beta: This field is beta and subject to change.

    - name: lifecycle
      level: extended
      type: object
      short: A set of temporal characteristics of the entity.
