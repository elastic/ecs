- name: server
  title: Server
  group: 2
  short: Fields about the server side of a network connection, used with client.
  description: >
    A Server is defined as the responder in a network connection for events regarding sessions, connections, or bidirectional flow records.

    For TCP events, the server is the receiver of the initial SYN packet(s) of the TCP connection.
    For other protocols, the server is generally the responder in the network transaction.
    Some systems actually use the term "responder" to refer the server in TCP connections.
    The server fields describe details about the system acting as the server in the network event.
    Server fields are usually populated in conjunction with client fields.
    Server fields are generally not populated for packet-level events.

    Client / server representations can add semantic context to an exchange,
    which is helpful to visualize the data in certain situations.
    If your context falls in that category, you should still ensure that source and destination are filled appropriately.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: address
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Server network address.
      description: >
        Some event server addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will
        sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always
        store the raw address in the `.address` field.

        Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which
        one it is.

    - name: ip
      level: core
      type: ip
      short: IP address of the server.
      description: >
        IP address of the server.

        Can be one or multiple IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

    - name: port
      format: string
      level: core
      type: long
      description: >
        Port of the server.

    - name: mac
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        MAC address of the server.

    - name: domain
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Server domain.

    - name: top_level_domain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The top level domain is the last part of the domain (com, net, org).
      description: >
        The top level domain (TLD) also known as the domain suffix is the last part of the domain name.
        For example, the top level domain for google.com is "com".

        The following groups of top level domain are maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

        Infrastructure top-level domain (ARPA)
        Generic top-level domains (gTLD)
        Restricted generic top-level domains (grTLD)
        Sponsored top-level domains (sTLD)
        Country code top-level domains (ccTLD)
        Internationalized country code top-level domains (IDN ccTLDs)
        Test top-level domains (tTLD)
