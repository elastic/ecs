  title: Server
  group: 2
  short: Fields about the server side of a network connection, used with client.
  description: >
    A Server is defined as the responder in a network connection for events regarding sessions, connections, or bidirectional flow records.

    For TCP events, the server is the receiver of the initial SYN packet(s) of the TCP connection.
    For other protocols, the server is generally the responder in the network transaction.
    Some systems actually use the term "responder" to refer the server in TCP connections.
    The server fields describe details about the system acting as the server in the network event.
    Server fields are usually populated in conjunction with client fields.
    Server fields are generally not populated for packet-level events.

    Client / server representations can add semantic context to an exchange,
    which is helpful to visualize the data in certain situations.
    If your context falls in that category, you should still ensure that source and destination are filled appropriately.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: address
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Server network address.
      description: >
        Some event server addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will
        sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always
        store the raw address in the `.address` field.

        Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which
        one it is.

    - name: ip
      level: core
      type: ip
      short: IP address of the server.
      description: >

        Can be one or multiple IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

    - name: port
      level: core
