  group: 2
  short: Fields to describe observer interface information.
  description: >
    The interface fields are used to record ingress and egress interface information when
    reported by an observer (e.g. firewall, router, load balancer) in the context of the
    observer handling a network connection.  In the case of a single observer interface
    (e.g. network sensor on a span port) only the observer.ingress information should be
    populated.

  reusable:
    top_level: false
    expected:
      - observer.ingress
      - observer.egress

      example: outside
      description: >

        inside, outside, or dmz logical interface naming.
