  title: Source
  group: 2
  short: Fields about the source side of a network connection, used with destination.
  description: >
    Source fields describe details about the source of a packet/event.

    Source fields are usually populated in conjunction with destination fields.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: address
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Source network address.
      description: >
        Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will
        sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always
        store the raw address in the `.address` field.

        Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which
        one it is.

    - name: ip
      level: core
      type: ip
      short: IP address of the source.
      description: >
        IP address of the source.

        Can be one or multiple IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

    - name: port
      format: string
      level: core
      type: long
      description: >
        Port of the source.

    - name: mac
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        MAC address of the source.

    - name: domain
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Source domain.

    - name: registered_domain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The highest registered source domain, stripped of the subdomain.
      description: >
        The highest registered source domain, stripped of the subdomain.

        For example, the registered domain for "foo.google.com" is "google.com".

        This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public
        suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by
        simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk".
      example: google.com

    - name: top_level_domain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The top level domain is the last part of the domain (com, net, org).
      description: >
        The top level domain (TLD) also known as the domain suffix is the last part of the domain name.
        For example, the top level domain for google.com is "com".

        The following groups of top level domain are maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

        Infrastructure top-level domain (ARPA)
        Generic top-level domains (gTLD)
        Restricted generic top-level domains (grTLD)
        Sponsored top-level domains (sTLD)
        Country code top-level domains (ccTLD)
        Internationalized country code top-level domains (IDN ccTLDs)
        Test top-level domains (tTLD)
