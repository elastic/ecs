    Low level details specific to log events.

    `log.*` typically contains lower level details about the logging mechanism
    than `event.*`. For example, The Syslog transport details belongs under `log.*`,
    whereas the message payloads transmitted via Syslog will likely be parsed out
    into `event.*` or elsewhere in ECS.

  fields:

    - name: level
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Log level of the log event.

      index: false
      doc_values: false
      short: Original log message with light interpretation only (encoding, newlines).
      description: >
        This is the original log message and contains the full log message
        before splitting it up in multiple parts.

        In contrast to the `message` field which can contain an extracted part
        of the log message, this field contains the original, full log message.
        It can have already some modifications applied like encoding or new
        lines removed to clean up the log message.

        This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled so it can't be
        queried but the value can be retrieved from `_source`.
