- name: log
  title: Log
  group: 2
  description: >
    Fields which are specific to log events.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: level
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Log level of the log event.
      description: >
        Original log level of the log event.

        Syslog's severity label should be stored here. Syslog's numeric severity
        is `event.severity` in ECS.

        Some examples are `warn`, `error`, `i`.
      example: err

    - name: facility
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      example: local7
      short: Syslog text-based facility of the event.
      description: >
        The Syslog text-based facility of the log event, if available. See RFCs
        5324 or 3164.

    - name: facility_code
      format: string
      level: extended
      type: long
      example: 23
      short: Syslog numeric facility of the event.
      description: >
        The Syslog numeric facility of the log event, if available.

        According to RFCs 5324 and 3164, this value should be an integer between 0 and 23.

    - name: priority
      format: string
      level: extended
      type: long
      example: 135
      short: Syslog priority of the event.
      description: >
        Syslog numeric priority of the event, if available.

        According to RFCs 5324 and 3164, the priority is 8 * facility + severity.
        Accordingly, this number should be between 0 and 191.

    - name: original
      level: core
      type: keyword
      example: "Sep 19 08:26:10 localhost My log"
      index: false
      doc_values: false
      short: Original log message with light interpretation only (encoding, newlines).
      description: >
        This is the original log message and contains the full log message
        before splitting it up in multiple parts.

        In contrast to the `message` field which can contain an extracted part
        of the log message, this field contains the original, full log message.
        It can have already some modifications applied like encoding or new
        lines removed to clean up the log message.

        This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled so it can't be
        queried but the value can be retrieved from `_source`.

    - name: logger
      level: core
      type: keyword
      example: org.elasticsearch.bootstrap.Bootstrap
      short: Name of the logger.
      description: >
        The name of the logger inside an application. This is usually the name of the class which initialized the logger, or can be a custom name.
