        Log level of the log event.

      example: ERR

    - name: original
      level: core
      type: keyword
      example: "Sep 19 08:26:10 localhost My log"
      index: false
      doc_values: false
      description: >

        This is the original log message and contains the full log message
        before splitting it up in multiple parts.

        In contrast to the `message` field which can contain an extracted part
        of the log message, this field contains the original, full log message.
        It can have already some modifications applied like encoding or new
        lines removed to clean up the log message.

        This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled so it can't be
        queried but the value can be retrieved from `_source`.
