  short: Details about the event's logging mechanism.
  description: >
    Low level details specific to log events.

    The log.* fields are typically populated with details about the logging
    mechanism used to create and/or transport the event.
    For example, syslog details belong under `log.syslog.*`.

    The details specific to your event source are typically not logged under `log.*`,
    but rather in `event.*` or in other ECS fields.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: level
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Log level of the log event.
      description: >
        Original log level of the log event.

        Some examples are `warn`, `error`, `i`.
      example: err

    - name: original
      level: core
      type: keyword
      example: "Sep 19 08:26:10 localhost My log"
      index: false
      doc_values: false
      short: Original log message with light interpretation only (encoding, newlines).
      description: >
        This is the original log message and contains the full log message
        before splitting it up in multiple parts.

        In contrast to the `message` field which can contain an extracted part
        of the log message, this field contains the original, full log message.
        It can have already some modifications applied like encoding or new
        lines removed to clean up the log message.

        This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled so it can't be
        queried but the value can be retrieved from `_source`.

    - name: logger
      level: core
      type: keyword
      example: org.elasticsearch.bootstrap.Bootstrap
      short: Name of the logger.
      description: >

      level: extended
      type: keyword
      example: Bootstrap.java
      short: The file which originated the log event.

        Note that this is not the name of the log file.

    - name: origin.file.line
      level: extended
      type: integer
      example: 42
