        ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events.

        When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly
        different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the
        schema version of the events.

        The current version is 0.1.0.
      example: 0.1.0
