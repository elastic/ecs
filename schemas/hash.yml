    The hash fields represent different hash algorithms and their values.

    Field names for common hashes (e.g. MD5, SHA1) are predefined. Add fields for other hashes
    by lowercasing the hash algorithm and using underscore separators as appropriate (snake case).

  reusable:
    top_level: false
    expected:
      - file
      - process

  fields:

    - name: md5
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: MD5 hash.

    - name: sha1
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: SHA1 hash.

    - name: sha256
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: SHA256 hash.

    - name: sha512
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: SHA512 hash.
