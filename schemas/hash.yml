- name: hash
  title: Hash
  group: 2
  type: group
  short: Hashes, usually file hashes.
  description: >
    The hash fields represent different bitwise hash algorithms and their values.

    Field names for common hashes (e.g. MD5, SHA1) are predefined. Add fields for other hashes
    by lowercasing the hash algorithm name and using underscore separators as appropriate
    (snake case, e.g. sha3_512).

    Note that this fieldset is used for common hashes that may be computed
    over a range of generic bytes. Entity-specific hashes such as ja3 or imphash are
    placed in the fieldsets to which they relate (tls and pe, respectively).
