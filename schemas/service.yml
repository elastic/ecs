    The service fields describe the service for or from which the data was
    collected. These fields help you find and correlate logs for a specific
    service and version.

  fields:
    - name: id
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Unique identifier of the running service.

        This id should uniquely identify this service. This makes it possible
        to correlate logs and metrics for one specific service. 
        
        Example: If you are experiencing issues with one redis instance, you
        can filter on that id to see metrics and logs for that single instance.

        Name of the service data is collected from.

        The name can be used to group and correlate logs and metrics from one
        service.
        
        Example: If logs or metrics are collected from Redis, `service.name` would be
        `redis`.

      description: >
        Version of the service the data was collected from.

        This allows to look at a data set only for a specific version of a
        service.
    - name: ephemeral_id
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Ephemeral identifier of this service (if one exists).

        This id normally changes across restarts, but `service.id` does not.
      example: 8a4f500f
