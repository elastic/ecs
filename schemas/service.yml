    The service fields describe the service for or from which the data was collected.

    These fields help you find and correlate logs for a specific
    service and version.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: id
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Unique identifier of the running service.
      description: >
        Unique identifier of the running service. If the service is comprised of
        many nodes, the `service.id` should be the same for all nodes.

        This id should uniquely identify the service. This makes it possible
        to correlate logs and metrics for one specific service, no matter which
        particular node emitted the event.

        Note that if you need to see the events from one specific host of the
        service, you should filter on that `host.name` or `host.id` instead.

    - name: name
      level: core
      type: keyword
      example: "elasticsearch-metrics"
      short: Name of the service.
      description: >
        Name of the service data is collected from.

        The name of the service is normally user given. This allows for
        distributed services that run on multiple hosts to correlate the
        related instances based on the name.

        In the case of Elasticsearch the `service.name` could contain the cluster
        name. For Beats the `service.name` is by default a copy of the `service.type`
        field if no name is specified.

    - name: node.name
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      example: "instance-0000000016"
      short: Name of the service node.
      description: >
        Name of a service node.

        This allows for two nodes of the same service running on the same
        host to be differentiated. Therefore, `service.node.name` should
        typically be unique across nodes of a given service.

        In the case of Elasticsearch, the `service.node.name` could contain
        the unique node name within the Elasticsearch cluster.
        In cases where the service doesn't have the concept of a node name,
        the host name or container name can be used to distinguish running
        instances that make up this service. If those do not provide uniqueness
        (e.g. multiple instances of the service running on the same host) - the
        node name can be manually set.


    - name: type
      level: core
      type: keyword
      example: "elasticsearch"
      short: The type of the service.
      description: >
        The type of the service data is collected from.

        The type can be used to group and correlate logs and metrics from one
        service type.

        Example: If logs or metrics are collected from Elasticsearch, `service.type` would be
        `elasticsearch`.

    - name: state
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Current state of the service.

    - name: version
      level: core
      type: keyword
      example: "3.2.4"
      short: Version of the service.
      description: >
        Version of the service the data was collected from.

        This allows to look at a data set only for a specific version of a
        service.

    - name: ephemeral_id
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Ephemeral identifier of this service.
      description: >
        Ephemeral identifier of this service (if one exists).

        This id normally changes across restarts, but `service.id` does not.
      example: 8a4f500f
