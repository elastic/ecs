    The service fields describe the service for or from which the data was collected.

    These fields help you find and correlate logs for a specific
    service and version.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: id
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Unique identifier of the running service.
      description: >
        Unique identifier of the running service.

        This id should uniquely identify this service. This makes it possible
        to correlate logs and metrics for one specific service.

        Example: If you are experiencing issues with one redis instance, you
        can filter on that id to see metrics and logs for that single instance.

      example: d37e5ebfe0ae6c4972dbe9f0174a1637bb8247f6

    - name: name
      level: core
      type: keyword
      example: "elasticsearch-metrics"
      short: Name of the service.
      description: >
        Name of the service data is collected from.

        The name of the service is normally user given. This allows if two
        instances of the same service are running on the same machine
        they can be differentiated by the `service.name`.

        Also it allows for distributed services that run on multiple hosts to
        correlate the related instances based on the name.

        In the case of Elasticsearch the service.name could contain the cluster
        name. For Beats the service.name is by default a copy of the `service.type`
        field if no name is specified.

    - name: type
      level: core
      type: keyword
      example: "elasticsearch"
      short: The type of the service.
      description: >
        The type of the service data is collected from.

        The type can be used to group and correlate logs and metrics from one
        service type.

        Example: If logs or metrics are collected from Elasticsearch, `service.type` would be
        `elasticsearch`.

    - name: state
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Current state of the service.

    - name: version
      level: core
      type: keyword
      example: "3.2.4"
      short: Version of the service.
      description: >
        Version of the service the data was collected from.

        This allows to look at a data set only for a specific version of a
        service.

    - name: ephemeral_id
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Ephemeral identifier of this service.
      description: >
        Ephemeral identifier of this service (if one exists).

        This id normally changes across restarts, but `service.id` does not.
      example: 8a4f500f
