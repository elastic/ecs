    Fields describing a Node.js runtime.

    These fields can be used for monitoring the performance of a Node.js application.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: active_handles
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: Current number of active libuv handles.
      description: >
        Current number of active libuv handles.

        The number of active libuv handles, likely held open by currently running I/O operations.

    - name: active_requests
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: Current number of active libuv requests.
      description: >
        Current number of active libuv requests.

        The number of active libuv requests, likely waiting for a response to an I/O operation.

    - name: eventloop.delay.avg.ns
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: The average number of nanoseconds of event loop delay for the reporting period.
      description: >
        The number of nanoseconds of event loop delay for the reporting period.

        Event loop delay is sampled every 10 milliseconds. Delays shorter than 10 milliseconds
        may not be observed, for example if a blocking operation starts and ends within the same
        sampling period.

    - name: memory.heap.allocated.bytes
      level: extended
      type: long
      format: bytes
      description: >
        The current allocated heap size in bytes.

    - name: memory.heap.used.bytes
      level: extended
      type: long
      format: bytes
      description: >
        The currently used heap size in bytes.
