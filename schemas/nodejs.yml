    Fields describing a Node.js runtime.

    These fields can be used for monitoring the performance of a Node.js application.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: handles.active
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: Current number of active libuv handles.
      description: >
        Current number of active libuv handles.

        The number of active libuv handles, likely held open by currently running I/O operations.

    - name: requests.active
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: Current number of active libuv requests.
      description: >
        Current number of active libuv requests.

        The number of active libuv requests, likely waiting for a response to an I/O operation.

    - name: eventloop.delay.avg
      level: extended
      type: long
      format: duration
      input_format: nanoseconds
      output_format: asMilliseconds
      output_precision: 2
      short: The average number of nanoseconds of event loop delay for the reporting period.
      description: >
        The average event loop delay for the reporting period.

        Event loop delay is sampled every 10 milliseconds. Delays shorter than 10 milliseconds
        may not be observed, for example if a blocking operation starts and ends within the same
        sampling period.

    - name: memory.heap.allocated
      level: extended
      type: long
      format: bytes
      description: >
        The current allocated heap size in bytes.

    - name: memory.heap.used
      level: extended
      type: long
      format: bytes
      description: >
        The currently used heap size in bytes.
