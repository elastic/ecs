    Fields describing a Java virtual machine (JVM) runtime.

    These fields can be used for monitoring the performance of a JVM-based application.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: memory.heap.used
      level: extended
      type: long
      format: bytes
      description: The amount of used heap memory.

    - name: memory.heap.committed
      level: extended
      type: long
      format: bytes
      short: The amount of heap memory committed for the Java virtual machine to use.
      description: >
        The amount of memory committed for the Java virtual machine to use.

        This amount of memory is guaranteed for the Java virtual machine to use.

    - name: memory.heap.max
      level: extended
      type: long
      format: bytes
      short: The maximum amount of heap memory that can be used for memory management.
      description: >
        The maximum amount of heap memory that can be used for memory management.

        If the maximum memory size is undefined, the value is `-1`

    - name: memory.non_heap.used
      level: extended
      type: long
      format: bytes
      description: The amount of used non-heap memory.

    - name: memory.non_heap.committed
      level: extended
      type: long
      format: bytes
      short: The amount of non-heap memory committed for the Java virtual machine to use.
      description: >
        The amount of non-heap memory committed for the Java virtual machine to use.

        This amount of memory is guaranteed for the Java virtual machine to use.

    - name: memory.non_heap.max
      level: extended
      type: long
      format: bytes
      short: The maximum amount of non-heap memory that can be used for memory management.
      description: >
        The maximum amount of heap memory that can be used for memory management.

        If the maximum memory size is undefined, the value is `-1`

    - name: thread.count
      level: extended
      type: long
      description: The current number of live threads in the JVM, including both daemon and non-daemon threads.

    - name: gc.count
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: The total number of garbage collections that have occurred.
      description: >
        The total number of garbage collections that have occurred.

        This metric may be reported multiple times for different memory managers, such as
        in the case of generational garbage collectors. The name of the memory manager is
        recorded as `label.name`.

    - name: gc.time
      level: extended
      type: long
      input_format: milliseconds
      output_format: asMilliseconds
      output_precision: 2
      short: The approximate accumulated collection elapsed time in milliseconds.
      description: >

        This metric may be reported multiple times for different memory managers, such as
        in the case of generational garbage collectors. The name of the memory manager is
        recorded as `label.name`.

    - name: gc.alloc
      level: extended
      type: long
      format: bytes
      short: An approximation of the total amount of memory allocated in heap memory.
      description: >
        An approximation of the total amount of memory allocated in heap memory.
