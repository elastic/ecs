  short: Fields describing an entity observing the event from outside the host.
  description: >
    An observer is defined as a special network, security, or application device
    used to detect, observe, or create network, security, or application-related events and metrics.

    This could be a custom hardware appliance or a server that has been configured
    to run special network, security, or application software.
    Examples include firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems,
    network monitoring sensors, web application firewalls, data loss prevention systems, and APM servers.
    The observer.* fields shall be populated with details of the system, if any,
    that detects, observes and/or creates a network, security, or application event or metric.
    Message queues and ETL components used in processing events or metrics are not considered observers in ECS.
