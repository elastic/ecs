  title: Observer
  group: 2
  short: Fields describing an entity observing the event from outside the host.
  description: >
    An observer is defined as a special network, security, or application device
    used to detect, observe, or create network, security, or application-related events and metrics.

    This could be a custom hardware appliance or a server that has been configured
    to run special network, security, or application software.
    Examples include firewalls, web proxies, intrusion detection/prevention systems,
    network monitoring sensors, web application firewalls, data loss prevention systems, and APM servers.
    The observer.* fields shall be populated with details of the system, if any,
    that detects, observes and/or creates a network, security, or application event or metric.
    Message queues and ETL components used in processing events or metrics are not considered observers in ECS.

      type: keyword
      short: Custom name of the observer.
      description: >
        Custom name of the observer.

        This is a name that can be given to an observer. This can be helpful
        for example if multiple firewalls of the same model are used in an
        organization.

        If no custom name is needed, the field can be left empty.

      example: 1_proxySG

    - name: product
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        The product name of the observer.
      example: s200

    - name: vendor
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Vendor name of the observer.
      example: Symantec

    - name: version
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Observer version.

    - name: serial_number

        Observer serial number.

    - name: type

      short: The type of the observer the data is coming from.
      description: >
        The type of the observer the data is coming from.

        There is no predefined list of observer types. Some examples are
        `forwarder`, `firewall`, `ids`, `ips`, `proxy`, `poller`, `sensor`, `APM server`.
      example: firewall

    - name: ingress
      level: extended
      type: object
      short: Object field for ingress information
      description: >
        Observer.ingress holds information like interface number and name, vlan, and zone information to 
        classify ingress traffic.  Single armed monitoring such as a network sensor on a span port should 
        only use observer.ingress to categorize traffic.

    - name: ingress.zone
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Observer ingress zone
      example: DMZ
      description: >
        Network zone of incoming traffic as reported by the observer to categorize the source area of ingress 
        traffic. e.g. internal, External, DMZ, HR, Legal, etc.
      
    - name: egress
      level: extended
      type: object
      short: Object field for egress information
      description: >
        Observer.egress holds information like interface number and name, vlan, and zone information to 
        classify egress traffic.  Single armed monitoring such as a network sensor on a span port should 
        only use observer.ingress to categorize traffic.

    - name: egress.zone
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Observer Egress zone
      example: Public_Internet
      description: >
        Network zone of outbound traffic as reported by the observer to categorize the destination area of egress 
        traffic, e.g. Internal, External, DMZ, HR, Legal, etc.
