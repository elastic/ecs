- name: container
  title: Container
  group: 2
  short: Fields describing the container that generated this event.
  description: >
    Container fields are used for meta information about the specific container
    that is the source of information.

    These fields help correlate data based containers from any runtime.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: cpu.usage
      type: scaled_float
      scaling_factor: 1000
      level: extended
      short: Percent CPU used, between 0 and 1.
      description: >
        Percent CPU used which is normalized by the number of CPU cores and it
        ranges from 0 to 1. Scaling factor: 1000.

    - name: disk.read.bytes
      type: long
      level: extended
      short: The number of bytes read by all disks.
      description: >
        The total number of bytes (gauge) read successfully (aggregated from all
        disks) since the last metric collection.

    - name: disk.write.bytes
      type: long
      level: extended
      short: The number of bytes written on all disks.
      description: >
        The total number of bytes (gauge) written successfully (aggregated from
        all disks) since the last metric collection.

    - name: id
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Unique container id.

    - name: image.name
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Name of the image the container was built on.

    - name: image.tag
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Container image tags.
      normalize:
        - array

    - name: image.hash.all
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: An array of digests of the image the container was built on.
      description: >
        An array of digests of the image the container was built on.
        Each digest consists of the hash algorithm and value in this format: `algorithm:value`.
        Algorithm names should align with the field names in the ECS hash field set.
      example: '[sha256:f8fefc80e3273dc756f288a63945820d6476ad64883892c771b5e2ece6bf1b26]'
      normalize:
        - array

    - name: labels
      level: extended
      type: object
      object_type: keyword
      description: >
        Image labels.

    - name: memory.usage
      type: scaled_float
      scaling_factor: 1000
      level: extended
      short: Percent memory used, between 0 and 1.
      description: >
        Memory usage percentage and it ranges from 0 to 1. Scaling factor: 1000.
