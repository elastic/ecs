  fields:

    - name: exists
      level: core
      type: boolean
      description: Boolean to capture if a signature is present.
      example: "true"

    - name: subject_name
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: Subject name of the code signer
      example: Microsoft Corporation

    - name: valid
      level: extended
      type: boolean
      short: Boolean to capture if the digital signature is verified against the binary content.
      example: "true"
      description: >
        Boolean to capture if the digital signature is verified against the binary content.

        Leave unpopulated if a certificate was unchecked.

    - name: trusted
      level: extended
      type: boolean
      short: Stores the trust status of the certificate chain.
      example: "true"
      description: >
        Stores the trust status of the certificate chain.

        Validating the trust of the certificate chain may be complicated, and this field should only be populated
        by tools that actively check the status.


    - name: status
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Additional information about the certificate status.
      description: >
        Additional information about the certificate status.

        This is useful for logging cryptographic errors with the certificate validity or trust status.
        Leave unpopulated if the validity or trust of the certificate was unchecked.
      example: ERROR_UNTRUSTED_ROOT
      
    - name: team_id
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The team identifier used to sign the process.
      description: >
        The team identifier used to sign the process.

        This is used to identify the team or vendor of a software product.
        The field is relevant to Apple *OS only.
      example: EQHXZ8M8AV
      
    - name: signing_id
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The identifier used to sign the process.
      description: >
        The identifier used to sign the process.

        This is used to identify the application manufactured by a software vendor.
        The field is relevant to Apple *OS only.
      example: com.apple.xpc.proxy
