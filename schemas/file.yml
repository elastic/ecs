  title: File
  short: Fields describing files.
  description: >
    A file is defined as a set of information that has been created on, or has existed on a filesystem.

    File objects can be associated with host events, network events,
    and/or file events (e.g., those produced by File Integrity Monitoring [FIM] products or services).
    File fields provide details about the affected file associated with the event or metric.

      type: long
      short: File size in bytes.
      description: >
        File size in bytes.

        Only relevant when `file.type` is "file".
      example: 16384
      otel:
        - relation: match
    - name: mtime
      level: extended

      level: extended
      type: date
      short: Last time the file attributes or metadata changed.
      description: >
        Last time the file attributes or metadata changed.

        Note that changes to the file content will update `mtime`. This implies
        `ctime` will be adjusted at the same time, since `mtime` is an attribute
        of the file.
      otel:
        - relation: equivalent
          attribute: file.changed

      level: extended
      type: date
      short: Last time the file was accessed.

    - name: mime_type
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Media type of file, document, or arrangement of bytes.
      description: >
        MIME type should identify the format of the file or stream of bytes using IANA official types:
        https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml,
        where possible. When more than one type is applicable, the most specific
        type should be used.
    - name: fork_name
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        A fork is additional data associated with a filesystem object.

        On Linux, a resource fork is used to store additional data with a filesystem object. A file always has at
        least one fork for the data portion, and additional forks may exist.

        On NTFS, this is analogous to an Alternate Data Stream (ADS), and the default data stream for a file is just called $DATA.
        Zone.Identifier is commonly used by Windows to track contents downloaded from the Internet. An ADS is typically of the form:
        `C:\path\to\filename.extension:some_fork_name`, and `some_fork_name` is the value that should populate `fork_name`.
        `filename.extension` should populate `file.name`, and `extension` should populate `file.extension`.
        The full path, `file.path`, will include the fork name.

      short: A fork is additional data associated with a filesystem object.
      example: Zone.Identifer
