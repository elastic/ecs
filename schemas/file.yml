  title: File
  short: Fields describing files.
  description: >
    A file is defined as a set of information that has been created on, or has existed on a filesystem.

    File objects can be associated with host events, network events,
    and/or file events (e.g., those produced by File Integrity Monitoring [FIM] products or services).
    File fields provide details about the affected file associated with the event or metric.
  type: group
  fields:

        Attributes names will vary by platform. Here's a non-exhaustive list of values
        that are expected in this field: archive, compressed, directory, encrypted,
        execute, hidden, read, readonly, system, write.

    - name: type
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: File type (file, dir, or symlink).
      example: file

    - name: device

      example: sda

    - name: inode

      description: Mode of the file in octal representation.
      example: "0640"

    - name: size
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: File size in bytes.
      description: >
        File size in bytes.

        Only relevant when `file.type` is "file".
      example: 16384

    - name: mtime
      level: extended
      type: date
      description: Last time the file content was modified.

      type: date
      short: Last time the file attributes or metadata changed.
      description: >
        Last time the file attributes or metadata changed.

        Note that changes to the file content will update `mtime`. This implies
        `ctime` will be adjusted at the same time, since `mtime` is an attribute
        of the file.

    - name: created
      level: extended
      type: date
      short: File creation time.
      description: >

        Note that not all filesystems store the creation time.

    - name: accessed
      level: extended
      type: date
      short: Last time the file was accessed.
      description: >
        Last time the file was accessed.

    - name: mime_type
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Media type of file, document, or arrangement of bytes.
      description: >
        MIME type should identify the format of the file or stream of bytes using
        https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml[IANA official types],
        where possible. When more than one type is applicable, the most specific
        type should be used.
