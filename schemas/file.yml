  short: Fields describing files.
  description: >
     A file is defined as a set of information that has been created on, or has existed on a filesystem.

     File objects can be associated with host events, network events,
     and/or file events (e.g., those produced by File Integrity Monitoring [FIM] products or services).
     File fields provide details about the affected file associated with the event or metric.

      of the file.
