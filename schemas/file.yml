  title: File
  short: Fields describing files.
  description: >
    A file is defined as a set of information that has been created on, or has existed on a filesystem.

    File objects can be associated with host events, network events,
    and/or file events (e.g., those produced by File Integrity Monitoring [FIM] products or services).
    File fields provide details about the affected file associated with the event or metric.
  type: group

      type: keyword
      short: Array of file attributes.
      description: >
        Array of file attributes.

        Attributes names will vary by platform. Here's a non-exhaustive list of values
        that are expected in this field: archive, compressed, directory, encrypted,
        execute, hidden, read, readonly, system, write.
      example: '["readonly", "system"]'
      normalize:
        - array

    - name: directory
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Directory where the file is located.
      description: >
        Directory where the file is located. It should include the drive letter,
        when appropriate.
      example: "/home/alice"

    - name: drive_letter
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      ignore_above: 1
      short: Drive letter where the file is located.
      description: >
        Drive letter where the file is located. This field is only relevant on Windows.

        The value should be uppercase, and not include the colon.
      example: C

    - name: path
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Full path to the file, including the file name.
      description: >
        Full path to the file, including the file name. It should include the
        drive letter, when appropriate.
      example: "/home/alice/example.png"
      multi_fields:
        - type: match_only_text
          name: text

    - name: target_path
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: Target path for symlinks.
      multi_fields:

          name: text

    - name: extension
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: File extension, excluding the leading dot.
      description: >
        File extension, excluding the leading dot.

        Note that when the file name has multiple extensions (example.tar.gz),
        only the last one should be captured ("gz", not "tar.gz").
      example: png

    - name: type
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: File type (file, dir, or symlink).
      example: file

    - name: device
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: Device that is the source of the file.
      example: sda

    - name: inode
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: Inode representing the file in the filesystem.
      example: "256383"

    - name: uid
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        The user ID (UID) or security identifier (SID) of the file owner.
      example: "1001"

    - name: owner
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: File owner's username.
      example: alice

    - name: gid
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: Primary group ID (GID) of the file.
      example: "1001"

    - name: group
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: Primary group name of the file.
      example: alice

    - name: mode
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: Mode of the file in octal representation.
      example: "0640"

    - name: size
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: File size in bytes.
      description: >
        File size in bytes.

        Only relevant when `file.type` is "file".
      example: 16384

    - name: mtime
      level: extended
      type: date
      description: Last time the file content was modified.

    - name: ctime
      level: extended
      type: date
      short: Last time the file attributes or metadata changed.
      description: >
        Last time the file attributes or metadata changed.

        Note that changes to the file content will update `mtime`. This implies
        `ctime` will be adjusted at the same time, since `mtime` is an attribute
        of the file.

    - name: created
      level: extended
      type: date
      short: File creation time.
      description: >
        File creation time.

        Note that not all filesystems store the creation time.

    - name: accessed
      level: extended
      type: date
      short: Last time the file was accessed.
      description: >
        Last time the file was accessed.

        Note that not all filesystems keep track of access time.

    - name: mime_type
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Media type of file, document, or arrangement of bytes.
      description: >
        MIME type should identify the format of the file or stream of bytes using
        https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml[IANA official types],
        where possible. When more than one type is applicable, the most specific
        type should be used.

    - name: fork_name
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        A fork is additional data associated with a filesystem object.

        On Linux, a resource fork is used to store additional data with a filesystem object. A file always has at
        least one fork for the data portion, and additional forks may exist.

        On NTFS, this is analogous to an Alternate Data Stream (ADS), and the default data stream for a file is just called $DATA.
        Zone.Identifier is commonly used by Windows to track contents downloaded from the Internet. An ADS is typically of the form:
        `C:\path\to\filename.extension:some_fork_name`, and `some_fork_name` is the value that should populate `fork_name`.
        `filename.extension` should populate `file.name`, and `extension` should populate `file.extension`.
        The full path, `file.path`, will include the fork name.

      short: A fork is additional data associated with a filesystem object.
      example: Zone.Identifer

    - name: origin_referrer_url
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      ignore_above: 8192
      description: The url of the webpage that linked to the file.

    - name: origin_url
      level: extended

      ignore_above: 8192
      description: The url where the file is hosted.
      example: https://example.com/file.zip
