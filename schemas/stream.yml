  title: Stream
  group: 2
  short: Fields about the monitoring agent.
  description: >
    The stream fields are part of the new [indexing strategy](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/docs/ingest_manager/index.asciidoc#indexing-strategy-1).

    These fields are used to determine into which index the data is shipped in Elasticsearch and
    allow efficient querying of data. Initially these fields are mainly used by data shipped by
    the Elastic Agent but any time series data shipper should switch to using data streams and
    the new indexing strategy with these fields.

    All three fields are `constant_keyword` fields.
  footnote: >
    Examples: The new indexing strategy is {stream.type}-{stream.dataset}-{stream.namespace}`.`
    As an example, nginx access logs are shipped into `logs-nginx.access-default`.
  type: group
  fields:
    - name: type
      level: extended
      type: constant_keyword
      short: Type of the stream.
      description: >
        Type of the stream.

        The type of the stream can be `logs` or `metrics`. More types can be added in the future but no
        other types then the one describe here should be used.

      example: logs

    - name: dataset
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Dataset describes the structure of the data.
      description: >
        Dataset describes the structure of the data.

        The dataset describes the structure of the data. All data shipped into a single dataset
        should have the same or very similar data structure. For example `system.cpu` and `system.disk`
        are two different datasets as they have very different fields.

        The name of the dataset should be descriptive of the data and it is encourage to use `.` to
        combine multiple words. All characters which are allowed in index names can be used for the dataset
        except `-`.

        The default for dataset is `generic`.
      example: nginx.access

    - name: namespace
      level: extended
      type: constant_keyword
      short: Namespace of your stream.
      description: >
        Namespace of your stream.

        This is the namespace used in your index. The namespace is used to separate
        the same structure into different Data Streams. For example if nginx logs
        are shipped for testing and production into the same cluster, two different
        namespaces can be used. This allows to assign different ILM policies as an example.

        The default value for a namespace is `default`.
      example: production
