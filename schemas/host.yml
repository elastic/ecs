- name: host
  title: Host
  group: 2
  short: Fields describing the relevant computing instance.
  description: >
    A host is defined as a general computing instance.

    ECS host.* fields should be populated with details about the host on which
    the event happened, or from which the measurement was taken.
    Host types include hardware, virtual machines, Docker containers, and Kubernetes nodes.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: hostname
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Hostname of the host.
      description: >
        Hostname of the host.

        It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine.

    - name: name
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Name of the host.
      description: >
        Name of the host.

        It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully
        qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender
        decides which value to use.

    - name: id
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Unique host id.
      description: >
        Unique host id.

        As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful
        in your environment.

        Example: The current usage of `beat.name`.
    - name: ip
      level: core
      type: ip
      description: >
        Host ip address.

    - name: mac
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Host mac address.

    - name: type
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Type of host.
      description: >
        Type of host.

        For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`.
        If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information
        meaningful in your environment.

    - name: architecture
      level: core
      type: keyword
      example: "x86_64"
      description: >
        Operating system architecture.
