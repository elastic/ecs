    Host fields provide information related to a host. A host can be a
    physical machine, a virtual machine, or a Docker container.

    Normally the host information is related to the machine on which the event
    was generated/collected, but they can be used differently if needed.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: hostname
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Hostname of the host.

        It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine.

    - name: name
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Name of the host.

        It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully
        qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender
        decides which value to use.

    - name: id
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Unique host id.

        As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful
        in your environment.

        Example: The current usage of `beat.name`.
    - name: ip
      level: core
      type: ip
      description: >
        Host ip address.

    - name: mac
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Host mac address.

    - name: type
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Type of host.

        For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`.
        If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information
        meaningful in your environment.

    - name: architecture
      level: core
      type: keyword
      example: "x86_64"
      description: >
        Operating system architecture.
