    A host is defined as a general computing instance that is not a device. ECS host.* fields should be populated with details about the host on which the event happened, or on which the measurement was taken. Hosts types include hardware, virtual machines, docker containers, and kubernetes nodes.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: hostname
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Hostname of the host.

        It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine.

    - name: name
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Name of the host.

        It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully
        qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender
        decides which value to use.

    - name: id
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Unique host id.

        As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful
        in your environment.

        Example: The current usage of `beat.name`.
    - name: ip
      level: core
      type: ip
      description: >
        Host ip address.

    - name: mac
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Host mac address.

    - name: type
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Type of host.

        For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`.
        If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information
        meaningful in your environment.

    - name: architecture
      level: core
      type: keyword
      example: "x86_64"
      description: >
        Operating system architecture.
