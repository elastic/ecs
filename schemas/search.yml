- name: search
  title: Search
  group: 2
  short: Fields to describe details of a search event.
  description: >
    The Search fields describe information about a search request event: query
    or pagination. The fields that should be used with this field set include:
    `event.action` to describe the search action (`query`, `page`, etc.),
    `event.duration` to describe the duration of a search request,
    `event.created` to record the event's timestamp and optionally `source`
    fields to record context information such as `user.id` or `geo`.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: query.id
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: An opaque query identifier.
      description: >
        An opaque query identifier. This identifier needs to be unique to a
        user query, and all subsequent events (pagination, clicks) need to have
        the same query identifier.
      example: "2dc15175-de0d-44db-86d8-8a99f41b7a11"

    - name: query.value
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      ignore_above: 4096
      short: The query string being searched on.
      description: >
        The query string being searched on. This field is not analyzed and
        should not be pre-processed in any way in the event (e.g. normalization
        list lowercasing). This is useful for search use-cases that use a one-
        box style search interface. Other interfaces will have to rely on
        additional custom fields or labels to represent things like filters
        applied, extra parameters, user context, etc.
      example: "where does the rain in Spain mainly fall"

    - name: query.page
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: The page of search results being requested.
      description: >
        For search results that support pagination, this represents the current
        page being requested. Initial search requests are `1` while
        subesequent page requests are incremental.
      example: 1

    - name: results.size
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: The size of the result set displayed to the user.
      description: >
        The size of the result set displayed to the user. This should be
        equivalent to the length of the results in `results.ids`. This is also
        known as the page size or limit.
      example: 10

    - name: results.total
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: The total number of matches for this query.
      description: >
        The total number of matches for this query. This number is always
        greater than or equal to `results.size`. This is the `hits.total` field
        in the query response.
      example: 134509

    - name: results.ids
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      normalize:
        - array
      short: A list of document IDs in the result set.
      description: >
        A list of opaque document IDs representing the results that were shown
        to the user. This is effectively the impression list and it's size
        should be equal to `results.size`. This field can be empty when there
        are no results to return.
      example: ["user:82375akja9f", "issue:2782630"]
