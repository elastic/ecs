- name: search
  title: Search
  group: 2
  short: Fields to describe details of a search event.
  description: >
    The Search fields describe information about a search request event: query
    or pagination. The fields that should be used with this field set include:
    `event.action` to describe the search action (e.g. `search.query`,
    `search.page`, etc.), `event.duration` to describe the duration of a search
    request, `@timestamp` to record the event's original timestamp and
    optionally the `source` fields to record context information such as
    `user.id` or `geo`.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: query.id
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: An opaque query identifier.
      description: >
        An opaque query identifier. This identifier needs to be unique to a
        user query, and all subsequent events (pagination, clicks) need to have
        the same query identifier.
      example: "2dc15175-de0d-44db-86d8-8a99f41b7a11"

    - name: query.value
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      ignore_above: 4096
      short: The query string being searched on.
      description: >
        The query string being searched on. This field is not analyzed and
        should not be pre-processed in any way in the event (e.g. normalization
        list lowercasing). This is useful for search use-cases that use a one-
        box style search interface. Other interfaces will have to rely on
        additional custom fields or labels to represent things like filters
        applied, extra parameters, user context, etc.
      example: "where does the rain in Spain mainly fall"

    - name: query.page
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: The page of search results being requested.
      description: >
        For search results that support pagination, this represents the current
        page being requested. Initial search requests are `1` while
        subsequent page requests are incremental.
      example: 1

    - name: results.size
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: The size of the result set displayed to the user.
      description: >
        The size of the result set displayed to the user. This should be
        equivalent to the length of the results in `results.ids`. This is also
        known as the page size or limit.
      example: 10

    - name: results.total
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: The total number of matches for this query.
      description: >
        The total number of matches for this query. This number is always
        greater than or equal to `results.size`. This is the `hits.total` field
        in the query response.
      example: 134509

    - name: results.document
      level: extended
      type: object
      normalize:
        - array
      short: A list of documents in the result set.
      description: >
        A list of documents representing the results that were shown to the
        user. This is effectively the impression list and it's size should be
        equal to `results.size`. This field can be empty when there are no
        results to return.

    - name: results.document.id
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The ID of the retrieved document.
      description: >
        An opaque document ID representing the result that was shown to the
        user. This ID should be unique within the index it was retrieved from.
        The combination of document ID and index should be globally unique.
      example: ["user:82375akja9f", "issue:2782630"]

    - name: results.document.index
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The index the document was retrieved from.
      description: >
        The name of the index that the result document was retrieved from. This
        can be considered as optional if all search results are always
        retrieved from same index. The combination of document ID and index
        should be globally unique.
      example: ["users", "issues-032020"]
