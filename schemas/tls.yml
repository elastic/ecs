    The tls fields contains the TLS related data about a specific connection.

    As an example in the case of Filebeat and the TCP input, the `version` field would be the
    version of the TLS protocol in use, the `certificates` would be the chain of certificates
    provided by the client and the `ciphersuite` is the encryption algorithm used for the
    communication.
  fields:
    - name: version
      type: keyword
