      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Identifier of the vulnerability.
      description: >
        The type of identifier used for this vulnerability.

    - name: score.base
      level: extended
      type: float
      short: Vulnerability Base score.
      description: >
        Scores can range from 0.0 to 10.0, with 10.0 being the most severe.

        Base scores cover an assessment for exploitability metrics (attack vector,
        complexity, privileges, and user interaction), impact metrics (confidentiality,
        integrity, and availability), and scope.
        For example (https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document)

      example: 5.5

    - name: score.temporal
      level: extended
      type: float
      short: Vulnerability Temporal score.
      description: >
        Scores can range from 0.0 to 10.0, with 10.0 being the most severe.

        Temporal scores cover an assessment for code maturity, remediation level, and
        confidence.
        For example (https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document)

    - name: score.environmental
      level: extended
      type: float
      short: Vulnerability Environmental score.
      description: >
        Scores can range from 0.0 to 10.0, with 10.0 being the most severe.

        Environmental scores cover an assessment for any modified Base metrics,
        confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements.
        For example (https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document)

      example: 5.5

    - name: score.version
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: CVSS version.
      description: >
        The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) provides qualitative severity rankings
        of "Low", "Medium", and "High" for CVSS v2.0 base score ranges in addition to the
        severity ratings for CVSS v3.0 as they are defined in the CVSS v3.0 specification.

        CVSS is owned and managed by FIRST.Org, Inc. (FIRST), a US-based non-profit
        organization, whose mission is to help computer security incident response teams
        across the world.
        For example (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
