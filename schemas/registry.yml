        Content when writing string types.

        Populated as an array when writing string data to the registry.
        For single string registry types (REG_SZ, REG_EXPAND_SZ), this should be an array with one string.
        For sequences of string with REG_MULTI_SZ, this array will be variable length.
        For numeric data, such as REG_DWORD and REG_QWORD, this should be populated with the decimal representation (e.g `"1"`).
      normalize:
        - array

    - name: data.bytes
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Original bytes written with base64 encoding.
      example: "ZQBuAC0AVQBTAAAAZQBuAAAAAAA="
      description: >
        Original bytes written with base64 encoding.

        For Windows registry operations, such as SetValueEx and RegQueryValueEx, this corresponds to the data pointed by `lp_data`.
        This is optional but provides better recoverability and should be populated for REG_BINARY encoded values.
