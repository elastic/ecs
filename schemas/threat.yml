   Fields to classify events and alerts according to a threat taxonomy such as the Mitre ATT&CK framework.

   These fields are for users to classify alerts from all of their sources (e.g. IDS, NGFW, etc.) within a
   common taxonomy. The threat.tactic.* are meant to capture the high level category of the threat
   (e.g. "impact"). The threat.technique.* fields are meant to capture which kind of approach is used by
   this detected threat, to accomplish the goal (e.g. "endpoint denial of service").

  type: group
  fields:

    - name: framework
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Threat classification framework.
      description: >
        Name of the threat framework used to further categorize and classify the tactic and technique of the reported threat.
        Framework classification can be provided by detecting systems, evaluated at ingest time, or retrospectively tagged to events.

      example: MITRE ATT&CK
