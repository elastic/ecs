  description: >
   Fields to classify events and alerts according to a threat taxonomy such as the MITRE ATT&CK® framework.

   These fields are for users to classify alerts from all of their sources (e.g. IDS, NGFW, etc.) within a
   common taxonomy. The threat.tactic.* fields are meant to capture the high level category of the threat
   (e.g. "impact"). The threat.technique.* fields are meant to capture which kind of approach is used by
   this detected threat, to accomplish the goal (e.g. "endpoint denial of service").
