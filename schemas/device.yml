      short: The unique identifier of a device. 
      description: >
        The unique identifier of a device. The identifier must not change across application sessions but stay fixed for an instance of a (mobile) device. 

        On iOS, this value must be equal to the vendor identifier (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/1620059-identifierforvendor).
        On Android, this value must be equal to the Firebase Installation ID or a globally unique UUID which is persisted across sessions in your application.

        For GDPR and data protection law reasons this identifier should not carry information that would allow to identify a user.
