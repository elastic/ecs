- name: cloud
  title: Cloud
  group: 2
  short: Fields about the cloud resource.
  description: >
    Fields related to the cloud or infrastructure the events
    are coming from.
  footnote: >
    Examples: If Metricbeat is running on an EC2 host and fetches data from its
    host, the cloud info contains the data about this machine. If Metricbeat
    runs on a remote machine outside the cloud and fetches data from a service
    running in the cloud, the field contains cloud data from the machine the
    service is running on.

    The cloud fields may be self-nested under cloud.origin.* and cloud.target.*
    to describe origin or target service's cloud information in the context of
    incoming or outgoing requests, respectively. However, the fieldsets
    cloud.origin.* and cloud.target.* must not be confused with the root cloud
    fieldset that is used to describe the cloud context of the actual service
    under observation. The fieldset cloud.origin.* may only be used in the
    context of incoming requests or events to provide the originating service's
    cloud information. The fieldset cloud.target.* may only be used in the
    context of outgoing requests or events to describe the target service's
    cloud information.
