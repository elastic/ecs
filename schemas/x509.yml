- name: x509
  title: x509 Certificate
  group: 2
  short: These fields contain x509 certificate metadata.
  description: >
    This implements the common core fields for x509 certificates. This information is likely logged with TLS sessions,
    digital signatures found in executable binaries, S/MIME information in email bodies, or analysis of files on disk.

    When the certificate relates to a file, use the fields at `file.x509`. When hashes of the DER-encoded
    certificate are available, the `hash` data set should be populated as well (e.g. `file.hash.sha256`).

    Events that contain certificate information about network connections, should use the x509 fields
    under the relevant TLS fields: `tls.server.x509` and/or `tls.client.x509`.
