  fields:

    - name: request.id
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: HTTP request ID.
      description: >
        A unique identifier for each HTTP request to correlate logs between clients
        and servers in transactions.

        The id may be contained in a non-standard HTTP header, such as `X-Request-ID`
        or `X-Correlation-ID`.

      example: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000

    - name: request.method
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: HTTP request method.
      description: >
        HTTP request method.

        The value should retain its casing from the original event.
        For example, `GET`, `get`, and `GeT` are all considered valid values
        for this field.

      example: POST

    - name: request.mime_type
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Mime type of the body of the request.
      description: >
       Mime type of the body of the request.

       This value must only be populated based on the content of the request
       body, not on the `Content-Type` header. Comparing the mime type of a
       request with the request's Content-Type header can be helpful in detecting
       threats or misconfigured clients.

      example: image/gif

    - name: request.body.content
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        The full HTTP request body.
      example: Hello world
      multi_fields:
      - type: text
        name: text

    - name: request.referrer
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Referrer for this HTTP request.
      example: https://blog.example.com/

      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Mime type of the body of the response.
      description: >
       Mime type of the body of the response.

       This value must only be populated based on the content of the response
       body, not on the `Content-Type` header. Comparing the mime type of a
       response with the response's Content-Type header can be helpful in detecting
       misconfigured servers.

      example: image/gif

    - name: response.body.content
