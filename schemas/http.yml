      short: HTTP request method.

        HTTP request method.

        Prior to ECS 1.6.0 the following guidance was provided:

        "The field value must be normalized to lowercase for
        querying."

        As of ECS 1.6.0, the guidance is deprecated because the
        original case of the method may be useful in anomaly
        detection.  Original case will be mandated in ECS 2.0.0

      example: GET, POST, PUT, PoST

    - name: request.mime_type
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Mime type of the body of the request.
      description: >
       Mime type of the body of the request.

       This value must only be populated based on the content of the request
       body, not on the `Content-Type` header. Comparing the mime type of a
       request with the request's Content-Type header can be helpful in detecting
       threats or misconfigured clients.

      example: image/gif

    - name: request.body.content
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        The full HTTP request body.
      example: Hello world
      multi_fields:
      - type: text
        name: text

    - name: request.referrer
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Referrer for this HTTP request.
      example: https://blog.example.com/

      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Mime type of the body of the response.
      description: >
       Mime type of the body of the response.

       This value must only be populated based on the content of the response
       body, not on the `Content-Type` header. Comparing the mime type of a
       response with the response's Content-Type header can be helpful in detecting
       misconfigured servers.

      example: image/gif

    - name: response.body.content
