      short: HTTP request method.
      description: >
        HTTP request method.

        Prior to ECS 1.6.0 the following guidance was provided:

        "The field value must be normalized to lowercase for
        querying."

        As of ECS 1.6.0, the guidance is deprecated because the
        original case of the method may be useful in anomaly
        detection.  Original case will be mandated in ECS 2.0.0

      example: GET, POST, PUT, PoST
