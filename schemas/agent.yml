    The agent fields contains the data about the agent/client/shipper that
    created the event.

    As an example in case of Beats for logs the `agent.name` is `filebeat`.
    In the case of APM it is the agent running in the app / service. The agent
    information does not change if data is sent through queuing system like
    Kafka, Redis, or processing systems like Logstash or APM Server.

    - name: version

    - name: id

        In the case of Beats this would be beat.id.

    - name: ephemeral_id
      type: keyword

        This id compared to id normally changes across restarts.
