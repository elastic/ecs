    The agent fields contain the data about the agent/client/shipper that
    created the event.
  footnote: >
    Examples: In the case of Beats for logs, the agent.name is filebeat. For APM, it is the
    agent running in the app/service. The agent information does not change if
    data is sent through queuing systems like Kafka, Redis, or processing systems
    such as Logstash or APM Server.
