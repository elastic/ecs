- name: agent
  title: Agent
  group: 2
  description: >
    The agent fields contain the data about the agent/client/shipper that
    created the event.

    Examples: In the case of Beats for logs, the `agent.name` is `filebeat`. For
    APM, it is the agent running in the app/service. The agent information does
    not change if data is sent through queuing systems like Kafka, Redis, or
    processing systems like Logstash or APM Server.
    
  fields:
    - name: version
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Version of the agent.

      example: 6.0.0-rc2
    - name: name
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Name of the agent.
        
      example: filebeat
    - name: id
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists).

        Example: For Beats this would be beat.id.
      example: 8a4f500d
    - name: ephemeral_id
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Ephemeral identifier of this agent (if one exists).

        This id normally changes across restarts, but `agent.id` does not.
      example: 8a4f500f
