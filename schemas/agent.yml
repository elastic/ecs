  title: Agent
  group: 2
  short: Fields about the monitoring agent.
  description: >
    The agent fields contain the data about the software entity, if any, that collects, detects, or observes events on a host, or takes measurements on a host.

    Examples include Beats. Agents may also run on observers. ECS agent.* fields shall be populated with details of the agent running on the host or observer where the event happened or the measurement was taken.
  footnote: >
    Examples: In the case of Beats for logs, the agent.name is filebeat. For APM, it is the
    agent running in the app/service. The agent information does not change if
    data is sent through queuing systems like Kafka, Redis, or processing systems
    such as Logstash or APM Server.

        Version of the agent.

      example: 6.0.0-rc2

        Extended build information for the agent.

        This field is intended to contain any build information that a data source
        may provide, no specific formatting is required.
      example: metricbeat version 7.6.0 (amd64), libbeat 7.6.0 [6a23e8f8f30f5001ba344e4e54d8d9cb82cb107c built 2020-02-05 23:10:10 +0000 UTC]

    - name: name
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Custom name of the agent.
      description: >
        Custom name of the agent.

        This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if
        for example two Filebeat instances are running on the same host
        but a human readable separation is needed on which Filebeat instance
        data is coming from.

        If no name is given, the name is often left empty.
      example: foo

    - name: type
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Type of the agent.
      description: >
        Type of the agent.

        The agent type always stays the same and should be given by the agent used.
        In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if two
        Filebeat instances are run on the same machine.
      example: filebeat

    - name: id
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Unique identifier of this agent.
      description: >
        Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists).

        Example: For Beats this would be beat.id.
      example: 8a4f500d

    - name: ephemeral_id
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Ephemeral identifier of this agent.
      description: >
        Ephemeral identifier of this agent (if one exists).

        This id normally changes across restarts, but `agent.id` does not.
      example: 8a4f500f
