    The agent fields contain the data about the agent/client/shipper that
    created the event.
  footnote: >
    Examples: In the case of Beats for logs, the agent.name is filebeat. For APM, it is the
    agent running in the app/service. The agent information does not change if
    data is sent through queuing systems like Kafka, Redis, or processing systems
    such as Logstash or APM Server.

  fields:

    - name: version

        Version of the agent.

      example: 6.0.0-rc2

        Name of the agent.

        This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if
        for example two Filebeat instances are running on the same host
        but a human readable separation is needed on which Filebeat instance
        data is coming from.

        If no name is given, the name is often left empty.
      example: foo

        Type of the agent.

        The agent type stays always the same and should be given by the agent used.
        In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if two
        Filebeat instances are run on the same machine.
      example: filebeat

    - name: id
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists).

        Example: For Beats this would be beat.id.
      example: 8a4f500d

    - name: ephemeral_id
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Ephemeral identifier of this agent (if one exists).

        This id normally changes across restarts, but `agent.id` does not.
      example: 8a4f500f
