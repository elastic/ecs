- name: destination
  title: Destination
  group: 2
  short: Fields about the destination side of a network connection, used with source.
  description: >
    Destination fields describe details about the destination of a packet/event.

    Destination fields are usually populated in conjunction with source fields.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: address
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Destination network address.
      description: >
        Some event destination addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will
        sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always
        store the raw address in the `.address` field.

        Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which
        one it is.

    - name: ip
      level: core
      type: ip
      short: IP address of the destination.
      description: >
        IP address of the destination.

        Can be one or multiple IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

    - name: port
      format: string
      level: core
      type: long
      description: >
        Port of the destination.

    - name: mac
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        MAC address of the destination.

    - name: domain
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Destination domain.

    - name: registered_domain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The highest registered destination domain, stripped of the subdomain.
      description: >
        The highest registered destination domain, stripped of the subdomain.

        For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com".

        This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public
        suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by
        simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk".
      example: example.com

    - name: top_level_domain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The effective top level domain (com, org, net, co.uk).
      description: >
        The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix,
        is the last part of the domain name.
        For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com".

        This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public
        suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by
        simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk".
      example: co.uk

    - name: bytes
      format: bytes
      level: core
      type: long
      example: 184
      description: >
        Bytes sent from the destination to the source.

        Packets sent from the destination to the source.

    - name: nat.ip
      level: extended
      type: ip
      short: Destination NAT ip
      description: >
        Translated ip of destination based NAT sessions (e.g. internet to private DMZ)

        Typically used with load balancers, firewalls, or routers.

    - name: nat.port
      format: string
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: Destination NAT Port
      description: >
        Port the source session is translated to by NAT Device.

        Typically used with load balancers, firewalls, or routers.
