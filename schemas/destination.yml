- name: destination
  title: Destination
  group: 2
  short: Fields about the destination side of a network connection, used with source.
  description: >
    Destination fields capture details about the receiver of a network exchange/packet. These fields are populated from
    a network event, packet, or other event containing details of a network transaction.

    Destination fields are usually populated in conjunction with source fields. The source and destination
    fields are considered the baseline and should always be filled if an event contains source
    and destination details from a network transaction. If the event also contains identification of the
    client and server roles, then the client and server fields should also be populated.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: address
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Destination network address.
      description: >
        Some event destination addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will
        sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always
        store the raw address in the `.address` field.

        Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which
        one it is.

    - name: ip
      level: core
      type: ip
      short: IP address of the destination.
      description: >
        IP address of the destination (IPv4 or IPv6).

    - name: port
      format: string
      level: core
      type: long
      description: >
        Port of the destination.

    - name: mac
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: MAC address of the destination.
      example: 00-00-5E-00-53-23
      description: >
        MAC address of the destination.

        The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is
        represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of
        the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a
        hyphen.

    - name: domain
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Destination domain.

    - name: registered_domain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The highest registered destination domain, stripped of the subdomain.
      description: >
        The highest registered destination domain, stripped of the subdomain.

        For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com".

        This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public
        suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by
        simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk".
      example: example.com

    - name: top_level_domain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The effective top level domain (com, org, net, co.uk).
      description: >
        The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix,
        is the last part of the domain name.
        For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com".

        This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public
        suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by
        simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk".
      example: co.uk

    - name: subdomain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The subdomain of the domain.
      description: >
        The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all of the names except
        the host name under the registered_domain.  In a partially qualified domain, or if the
        the qualification level of the full name cannot be determined, subdomain contains all of
        the names below the registered domain.

        For example the subdomain portion of "www.east.mydomain.co.uk" is "east".
        If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com",
        the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period.
      example: east

        Typically used with load balancers, firewalls, or routers.
