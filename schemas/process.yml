    These fields contain information about a process.

    These fields can help you correlate metrics information with a process id/name
    from a log message.  The `process.pid` often stays in the metric itself and is
    copied to the global field for correlation.

  fields:

    - name: pid
      format: string
      level: core
      type: long
      description: >
        Process id.
      example: 4242

    - name: entity_id
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Unique identifier for the process.
      description: >
        Unique identifier for the process.

        The implementation of this is specified by the data source, but some
        examples of what could be used here are a process-generated UUID,
        Sysmon Process GUIDs, or a hash of some uniquely identifying components
        of a process.

        Constructing a globally unique identifier is a common practice to mitigate
        PID reuse as well as to identify a specific process over time, across multiple
        monitored hosts.

    - name: name
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Process name.
      description: >
        Process name.

        Sometimes called program name or similar.
      example: ssh

    - name: ppid

      format: string
      level: extended

      description: >
        Identifier of the group of processes the process belongs to.

    - name: command_line
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Full command line that started the process.
      description: >
        Full command line that started the process, including the absolute path
        to the executable, and all arguments.

        Some arguments may be filtered to protect sensitive information.
      example: "/usr/bin/ssh -l user 10.0.0.16"
      multi_fields:
      - type: text
        name: text

    - name: args
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Array of process arguments.
      description: >
        Array of process arguments, starting with the absolute path to the executable.

        May be filtered to protect sensitive information.
      example: "[\"/usr/bin/ssh\", \"-l\", \"user\", \"10.0.0.16\"]"
      normalize:
        - array

    - name: args_count
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: Length of the process.args array.
      description: >
        Length of the process.args array.

        This field can be useful for querying or performing bucket analysis on
        how many arguments were provided to start a process.
        More arguments may be an indication of suspicious activity.
      example: 4

    - name: executable
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Absolute path to the process executable.
      example: /usr/bin/ssh
      multi_fields:
      - type: text
        name: text

    - name: title
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Process title.
      description: >
        Process title.

        The proctitle, some times the same as process name. Can also be different:
        for example a browser setting its title to the web page currently opened.
      multi_fields:
      - type: text
        name: text

    - name: thread.id
      format: string
      level: extended
      type: long
      example: 4242
      description: >
        Thread ID.

    - name: thread.name
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      example: 'thread-0'
      description: >
        Thread name.

    - name: start
      level: extended
      type: date
      example: "2016-05-23T08:05:34.853Z"
      description: >
        The time the process started.

    - name: uptime
      level: extended
      type: long
      example: 1325
      description: >
        Seconds the process has been up.

    - name: working_directory
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      example: /home/alice
      description: >
        The working directory of the process.
      multi_fields:
      - type: text
        name: text

    - name: exit_code
      level: extended
      type: long
      example: 137
      short: The exit code of the process.
      description: >
        The exit code of the process, if this is a termination event.

        The field should be absent if there is no exit code for the event (e.g.
        process start).
