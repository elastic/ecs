    These fields contain information about a process.

    These fields can help you correlate metrics information with a process id/name
    from a log message.  The `process.pid` often stays in the metric itself and is
    copied to the global field for correlation.
  reusable:
    top_level: true

      - parent
      - target
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: pid
      format: string
      level: core
      type: long
      description: >
        Process id.
      example: 4242

    - name: name
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Process name.
      description: >
        Process name.

        Sometimes called program name or similar.
      example: ssh
      multi_fields:

    - name: user
      level: core

    - name: ppid
      format: string

      description: >
        Full command line that started the process, including the absolute path

        Some arguments may be filtered to protect sensitive information.

      level: extended
      type: long
      short: Length of the process.args array.
      description: >
        Length of the process.args array.

        This field can be useful for querying or performing bucket analysis on
        how many arguments were provided to start a process.
        More arguments may be an indication of suspicious activity.
      example: 4

    - name: executable
      level: extended
      type: keyword
