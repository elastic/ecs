# HEADS UP
# This field set supports capturing the parent process (one level).
#
# Doing so via normal reuse/nesting is tricky mainly because it's reused as a
# different name: the "process" field set is nested as "parent".
# This is the only occurrence of this in ECS, so it's not supported.
#
# The workaround is to simply duplicate each field to generate the "parent.*"
# equivalent of each "process.*" field. Please maintain each duplicate exactly as
# the main field (e.g. same wording & example), as if it was normal nesting.
#
# Each such duplicated field for the parent process is directly below the original
# field, which will hopefully help maintain this until a better solution is in place.

    These fields contain information about a process.

    These fields can help you correlate metrics information with a process id/name
    from a log message.  The `process.pid` often stays in the metric itself and is
    copied to the global field for correlation.
