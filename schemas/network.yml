  title: Network
  group: 2
  description: >
    The network is defined as the communication path over which a host or network event happens. The network.* fields should be populated with details about the network activity associated with an event.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: name
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Name given by operators to sections of their network.
      example: Guest Wifi

    - name: type
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        In the OSI Model this would be the Network Layer. ipv4, ipv6, ipsec, pim, etc

        The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. You can do
        so prior to ingestion by lowercasing the value, or you can use the
        `lowercase` normalizer in your indices. This lets you keep your field
        content with the original capitalization, but makes querying predictable
        across sources.
      example: ipv4

    - name: iana_number
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
          IANA Protocol Number (https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml).
          Standardized list of protocols. This aligns well with NetFlow and
          sFlow related logs which use the IANA Protocol Number.
      example: 6

    - name: transport
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Same as network.iana_number, but instead using the Keyword name of the
        transport layer (udp, tcp, ipv6-icmp, etc.)

    - name: application
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        A name given to an application. This can be arbitrarily assigned for
        things like microservices, but also apply to things like skype, icq,
        facebook, twitter. This would be used in situations where the vendor
        or service can be decoded such as from the source/dest IP owners,
        ports, or wire format.

    - name: direction

      type: keyword
      description: >
        Direction of the network traffic.

        Recommended values are:
          * inbound
          * outbound
          * internal
          * external
          * unknown

        When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this
        field from the host's point of view.

        When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context,
        populate this field from the point of view of your network perimeter.
      example: inbound

    - name: forwarded_ip
      level: core
      type: ip
      description: >
        Host IP address when the source IP address is the proxy.
      example: 192.1.1.2

    - name: community_id
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        A hash of source and destination IPs and ports, as well as the protocol
        used in a communication. This is a tool-agnostic standard to identify
        flows.

    # Metrics
    - name: bytes
      level: core
      type: long
      description: >
        Total bytes transferred in both directions.

        If `source.bytes` and `destination.bytes` are known, `network.bytes` is their sum.
      example: 368

    - name: packets
      level: core
      type: long
      description: >
        Total packets transferred in both directions.

        If `source.packets` and `destination.packets` are known, `network.packets` is their sum.
      example: 24
