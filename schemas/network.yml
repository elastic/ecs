- name: network
  title: Network
  group: 2
  short: Fields describing the communication path over which the event happened.
  description: >
    The network is defined as the communication path over which a host or network event happens.

    The network.* fields should be populated with details about the network activity associated with an event.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: name
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Name given by operators to sections of their network.
      example: Guest Wifi

    - name: type
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: In the OSI Model this would be the Network Layer. ipv4, ipv6, ipsec, pim, etc
      description: >
        In the OSI Model this would be the Network Layer. ipv4, ipv6, ipsec, pim, etc

        The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. See
        the documentation section "Implementing ECS".
      example: ipv4

    - name: iana_number
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: IANA Protocol Number.
      description: >
          IANA Protocol Number (https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml).
          Standardized list of protocols. This aligns well with NetFlow and
          sFlow related logs which use the IANA Protocol Number.
      example: 6

    - name: transport
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Protocol Name corresponding to the field `iana_number`.
      description: >
        Same as network.iana_number, but instead using the Keyword name of the
        transport layer (udp, tcp, ipv6-icmp, etc.)

        The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. See
        the documentation section "Implementing ECS".
      example: tcp

    - name: application
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: >
        Application level protocol name.
      description: >
        A name given to an application level protocol. This can be arbitrarily assigned for
        things like microservices, but also apply to things like skype, icq,
        facebook, twitter. This would be used in situations where the vendor
        or service can be decoded such as from the source/dest IP owners,
        ports, or wire format.

        The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. See
        the documentation section "Implementing ECS".
      example: aim

    - name: protocol
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: L7 Network protocol name.
      description: >
        L7 Network protocol name. ex. http, lumberjack, transport protocol.

        The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. See
        the documentation section "Implementing ECS".
      example: http

    - name: direction
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Direction of the network traffic.
      description: >
        Direction of the network traffic.

        Recommended values are:
          * inbound
          * outbound
          * internal
          * external
          * unknown

        When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this
        field from the host's point of view.

        When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context,
        populate this field from the point of view of your network perimeter.
      example: inbound

    - name: forwarded_ip
      level: core
      type: ip
      description: >
        Host IP address when the source IP address is the proxy.
      example: 192.1.1.2

    - name: community_id
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: A hash of source and destination IPs and ports.
      description: >
        A hash of source and destination IPs and ports, as well as the protocol
        used in a communication. This is a tool-agnostic standard to identify
        flows.

    # Metrics
    - name: bytes
      level: core
      type: long
      short: Total bytes transferred in both directions.
      description: >
        Total bytes transferred in both directions.

        If `source.bytes` and `destination.bytes` are known, `network.bytes` is their sum.
      example: 368

    - name: packets
      level: core
      type: long
      short: Total packets transferred in both directions.
      description: >
        Total packets transferred in both directions.

        If `source.packets` and `destination.packets` are known, `network.packets` is their sum.
      example: 24

    - name: locality
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      example: public
      description: >
        Locality can be either `private` or `public`. `private` indicates that
        both sides of the flow have IP addresses in the ranges reserved for
        private networks as defined below. `public` indicates that at least one
        side of the flow is outside of the private ranges. The IP addresses used
        in determining this field's value are `source.ip` and `destination.ip`.

        Address ranges that are considered private are
        * Loopback (127.0.0.0/8, ::1/128)
        * Unspecified (0.0.0.0, ::)
        * IPv4 Broadcast (255.255.255.255)
        * RFC 1918 - IPv4 Local Unicast (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16)
        * RFC 3927 - IPv4 Link-Local Unicast (169.254.0.0/16)
        * RFC 5771 - IPv4 Local Multicast (224.0.0.0/4)
        * RFC 4193 - IPv6 Local Unicast (fc00::/7)
        * RFC 4291 - IPv6 Link-Local Unicast (fe80::/10)
        * RFC 4291 - IPv6 Link-Local Multicast (ff02::/8)
        * RFC 4291 - IPv6 Interface Local Multicast (ff01::/8)
