Signed the [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.elastic.co/contributor-agreement) if you haven't already.

Ensured your changes align with the [ECS Guidelines and Best Practices](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/ecs/ecs-guidelines).

Filled in all of the sections below. -->

#### 1. What does this PR do?
<!-- Clearly describe the purpose and scope of your changes.

If this PR addresses an existing issue, please link it: Fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER or Closes #ISSUE_NUMBER. -->


#### 2. Which ECS fields are affected/introduced?
<!-- List all new or modified ECS fields.

For each, briefly explain its purpose and why it's needed within ECS.

If introducing new fields or making large changes to fields, please follow the [ECS RFC process](https://github.com/elastic/ecs/blob/main/rfcs/PROCESS.md)
and consider if they are generic enough for broader use cases beyond your immediate need. -->


#### 3. Why is this change necessary?
<!-- Explain the problem this PR solves or the new functionality it enables. Provide context and use cases where these changes would be beneficial. -->


#### 4. Have you added/updated documentation?
<!-- For new schema fields and larger changes, documenting the changes are part of the RFC process.

For smaller changes, it may be sufficient for documentation to be done within the schema itself, for example in the description field.

For script / generator changes, please ensure your code is documented, and consider adding separate documentation in `docs/` for larger or more complicated changes.

If you answer N/A, please explain why documentation is not needed. -->
