# Elastic Common Schema (ECS)

The Elastic Common Schema (ECS) defines a common set of fields for
ingesting data into Elasticsearch. A common schema helps you correlate
data from sources like logs and metrics or IT operations
analytics and security analytics.

ECS is still under development and backward compatibility is not guaranteed. Any
feedback on the general structure, missing fields, or existing fields is appreciated.
For contributions please read the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

<a name="ecs-version"></a>The current version of ECS is `0.1.0`.
