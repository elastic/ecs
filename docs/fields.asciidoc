| Fields  | Description  
| <<ecs-base,Base>> | The base set contains all fields which are on the top level.
 These fields are common across all types of events.
| <<ecs-agent,Agent>> | The agent fields contain data about the 
agent/client/shipper that created the event.
| <<ecs-cloud,Cloud>> | Fields related to the cloud or infrastructure the events are
 coming from.
| <<ecs-container,Container>> | Container fields are used for meta information about the specific container that
is the source of information. These fields help correlate data based containers
from any runtime.
| <<ecs-destination,Destination>> | Destination fields describe details about the destination of a packet/event.
| <<ecs-device,Device>> | Device fields are used to provide additional information 
about the device that is the source of the information. This could be a firewall, network device, etc.
| <<ecs-ecs,ECS>> | Meta-information specific to ECS.
| <<ecs-error,Error>> | These fields can represent errors of any kind. Use them for errors that happen
while fetching events or in cases where the event itself contains an error.
| <<ecs-event,Event>> | The event fields are used for context information about the data itself.
| <<ecs-file,File>> | File fields provide details about each file.
| <<ecs-geo,Geo>> | Geo fields can carry data about a specific location related to 
an event or geo information derived from an IP field.
The `geo` fields are expected to be nested at: `destination.geo`, `device.geo`, `host.geo`, `source.geo`.
| <<ecs-host,Host>> | Host fields provide information related to a host. A host can be a physical
machine, a virtual machine, or a Docker container.
| <<ecs-log,Log>> | Fields which are specific to log events.
| <<ecs-network,Network>> | Fields related to network data.
| <<ecs-organization,Organization>> | The organization fields enrich data with 
  information about the company or entity the data is associated with. These fields help
  you arrange or filter data stored in an index by one or multiple organizations.
| <<ecs-os,Operating System>> | The OS fields contain information about the operating system.
| <<ecs-process,Process>> | These fields contain information about a process. These fields can help you
correlate metrics information with a process id/name from a log message.  The
`process.pid` often stays in the metric itself and is copied to the global field
for correlation.
| <<ecs-service,Service>> | The service fields describe the service for or from which the data was
collected. These fields help you find and correlate logs for a specific service
and version.
| <<ecs-source,Source>> | Source fields describe details about the destination of a packet/event.
| <<ecs-url,URL>> | URL fields provide a complete URL, with scheme, host, and path.
| <<ecs-user,User>> | The user fields describe information about the user 
 that is relevant to the event. Fields can have one entry or multiple entries. 
 If a user has more than one id, provide an array that includes all of them.
