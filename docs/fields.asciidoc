== {ecs} Field Reference

This is the documentation of ECS version 1.5.0-dev.

ECS defines multiple groups of related fields. They are called "field sets".
The <<ecs-base,Base>> field set is the only one whose fields are defined
at the root of the event.

All other field sets are defined as objects in {es}, under which
all fields are defined.
