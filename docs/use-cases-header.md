# <a name="use-cases"></a>Use cases

These are example on how ECS fields can be used in different use cases. Most use
cases not only contain ECS fields but additional fields which are not in ECS to
describe the full use case. The fields which are not in ECS are in italic.

Contributions of additional uses cases on top of ECS are welcome.
