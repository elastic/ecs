== Using ECS

ECS fields follow a series of guidelines, to ensure a consistent and predictable
feel, across various use cases.

Whether you're trying to recall a field name, implementing a solution that
follows ECS, or proposing a change to  the schema, the <<ecs-guidelines>> and
<<ecs-conventions>> will help get you there.
