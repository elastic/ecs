== Using ECS

ECS fields follow a series of guidelines, to ensure a consistent and predictable
feel, across various use cases.

Whether you're trying to recall a field name, implementing a solution that
follows ECS, or proposing a change to  the schema, the <<ecs-guidelines>> and
<<ecs-conventions>> will help get you there.

If you're wondering how to best capture event details that don't map to existing
ECS fields, head over to <<ecs-custom-fields-in-ecs>>
