[[ecs-base]]
=== Base Fields

The `base` field set contains all fields which are on the top level. These fields are common across all types of events.

==== Base Field Details

[options="header"]
|=====
| Field  | Description | Level

// ===============================================================

| @timestamp
| Date/time when the event originated.

This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.

If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.

Required field for all events.

type: date

example: `2016-05-23T08:05:34.853Z`

| core

// ===============================================================

| labels
| Custom key/value pairs.

Can be used to add meta information to events. Should not contain nested objects. All values are stored as keyword.

Example: `docker` and `k8s` labels.

type: object

example: `{'application': 'foo-bar', 'env': 'production'}`

| core

// ===============================================================

| message
| For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer.

For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.

If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.

type: text

example: `Hello World`

| core

// ===============================================================

| tags
| List of keywords used to tag each event.

type: keyword

example: `["production", "env2"]`

| core

// ===============================================================

The agent fields contain the data about the software entity, if any, that collects, detects, or observes events on a host, or takes measurements on a host.

Examples include Beats. Agents may also run on observers. ECS agent.* fields shall be populated with details of the agent running on the host or observer where the event happened or the measurement was taken.

==== Agent Field Details

[options="header"]
|=====
| Field  | Description | Level

// ===============================================================

| agent.ephemeral_id
| Ephemeral identifier of this agent (if one exists).

This id normally changes across restarts, but `agent.id` does not.

type: keyword

example: `8a4f500f`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| agent.id
| Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists).

Example: For Beats this would be beat.id.

type: keyword

example: `8a4f500d`

| core

// ===============================================================

| agent.name
| Custom name of the agent.

This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if for example two Filebeat instances are running on the same host but a human readable separation is needed on which Filebeat instance data is coming from.

If no name is given, the name is often left empty.

type: keyword

example: `foo`

| core

// ===============================================================

| agent.type
| Type of the agent.

The agent type stays always the same and should be given by the agent used. In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if two Filebeat instances are run on the same machine.

type: keyword

[[ecs-client]]
=== Client Fields

A client is defined as the initiator of a network connection for events regarding sessions, connections, or bidirectional flow records.

For TCP events, the client is the initiator of the TCP connection that sends the SYN packet(s). For other protocols, the client is generally the initiator or requestor in the network transaction. Some systems use the term "originator" to refer the client in TCP connections. The client fields describe details about the system acting as the client in the network event. Client fields are usually populated in conjunction with server fields. Client fields are generally not populated for packet-level events.

Client / server representations can add semantic context to an exchange, which is helpful to visualize the data in certain situations. If your context falls in that category, you should still ensure that source and destination are filled appropriately.

==== Client Field Details

[[ecs-event]]
=== Event Fields

The event fields are used for context information about the log or metric event itself.

A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened. Log events must include the time at which the thing happened. Examples of log events include a process starting on a host, a network packet being sent from a source to a destination, or a network connection between a client and a server being initiated or closed. A metric is defined as an event containing one or more numerical or categorical measurements and the time at which the measurement was taken. Examples of metric events include memory pressure measured on a host, or vulnerabilities measured on a scanned host.

==== Event Field Details

[options="header"]
|=====
| Field  | Description | Level

// ===============================================================

| event.action
| The action captured by the event.

This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer.

type: keyword

example: `user-password-change`

| core

// ===============================================================

| event.category
| Event category.

This contains high-level information about the contents of the event. It is more generic than `event.action`, in the sense that typically a category contains multiple actions. Warning: In future versions of ECS, we plan to provide a list of acceptable values for this field, please use with caution.

type: keyword

example: `user-management`

| core

// ===============================================================

| event.code
| Identification code for this event, if one exists.

Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID.

type: keyword

example: `4648`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| event.created
| event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline.

This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event.

In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source.

In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used.

type: date



| core

// ===============================================================

| event.dataset
| Name of the dataset.

If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from.

It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name.

type: keyword

| event.id
| Unique ID to describe the event.

type: keyword

example: `8a4f500d`

| core

// ===============================================================

| event.kind
| The kind of the event.

This gives information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event.  Examples are `event`, `state`, `alarm`. Warning: In future versions of ECS, we plan to provide a list of acceptable values for this field, please use with caution.

type: keyword

example: `state`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| event.module
| Name of the module this data is coming from.

If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module.

type: keyword

example: `apache`

| core

// ===============================================================

| event.original
| Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity.

This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`.

// ===============================================================

| event.provider
| Source of the event.

Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd), or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing).

type: keyword

example: `kernel`

| extended

// ===============================================================

[[ecs-observer]]
=== Observer Fields

An observer is defined as a special network, security, or application device used to detect, observe, or create network, security, or application-related events and metrics.

This could be a custom hardware appliance or a server that has been configured to run special network, security, or application software. Examples include firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, network monitoring sensors, web application firewalls, data loss prevention systems, and APM servers. The observer.* fields shall be populated with details of the system, if any, that detects, observes and/or creates a network, security, or application event or metric. Message queues and ETL components used in processing events or metrics are not considered observers in ECS.

[[ecs-related]]
=== Related Fields

This field set is meant to facilitate pivoting around a piece of data.

Some pieces of information can be seen in many places in an ECS event. To facilitate searching for them, store an array of all seen values to their corresponding field in `related.`.

A concrete example is IP addresses, which can be under host, observer, source, destination, client, server, and network.forwarded_ip. If you append all IPs to `related.ip`, you can then search for a given IP trivially, no matter where it appeared, by querying `related.ip:a.b.c.d`.

==== Related Field Details

[options="header"]

// ===============================================================

|=====

[[ecs-server]]
=== Server Fields

A Server is defined as the responder in a network connection for events regarding sessions, connections, or bidirectional flow records.

For TCP events, the server is the receiver of the initial SYN packet(s) of the TCP connection. For other protocols, the server is generally the responder in the network transaction. Some systems actually use the term "responder" to refer the server in TCP connections. The server fields describe details about the system acting as the server in the network event. Server fields are usually populated in conjunction with client fields. Server fields are generally not populated for packet-level events.

Client / server representations can add semantic context to an exchange, which is helpful to visualize the data in certain situations. If your context falls in that category, you should still ensure that source and destination are filled appropriately.

==== Server Field Details

[options="header"]
|=====
| Field  | Description | Level

// ===============================================================

| server.address
| Some event server addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field.

Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is.

type: keyword

[[ecs-service]]
=== Service Fields

The service fields describe the service for or from which the data was collected.

These fields help you find and correlate logs for a specific service and version.

==== Service Field Details

[options="header"]
|=====
| Field  | Description | Level

// ===============================================================

| Ephemeral identifier of this service (if one exists).

This id normally changes across restarts, but `service.id` does not.

type: keyword

example: `8a4f500f`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| service.id
| Unique identifier of the running service.

This id should uniquely identify this service. This makes it possible to correlate logs and metrics for one specific service.

Example: If you are experiencing issues with one redis instance, you can filter on that id to see metrics and logs for that single instance.

type: keyword

example: `d37e5ebfe0ae6c4972dbe9f0174a1637bb8247f6`

| core

// ===============================================================

| service.name
| Name of the service data is collected from.

The name of the service is normally user given. This allows if two instances of the same service are running on the same machine they can be differentiated by the `service.name`.

Also it allows for distributed services that run on multiple hosts to correlate the related instances based on the name.

In the case of Elasticsearch the service.name could contain the cluster name. For Beats the service.name is by default a copy of the `service.type` field if no name is specified.

type: keyword

example: `elasticsearch-metrics`

| core

// ===============================================================

| service.state
| Current state of the service.

type: keyword



| core
