[[ecs-base]]
=== Base Fields

The `base` field set contains all fields which are at the root of the events. These fields are common across all types of events.

==== Base Field Details

[options="header"]
|=====
| Field  | Description | Level

// ===============================================================

| @timestamp
| Date/time when the event originated.

This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.

If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.

Required field for all events.

type: date



example: `2016-05-23T08:05:34.853Z`

| core

// ===============================================================

| labels
| Custom key/value pairs.

Can be used to add meta information to events. Should not contain nested objects. All values are stored as keyword.

Example: `docker` and `k8s` labels.

type: object



example: `{"application": "foo-bar", "env": "production"}`

| core

// ===============================================================

| message
| For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer.

For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.

If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.

type: text



example: `Hello World`

| core

// ===============================================================

| tags
| List of keywords used to tag each event.

type: keyword


Note: this field should contain an array of values.



example: `["production", "env2"]`

| core

// ===============================================================

|=====

Examples include Beats. Agents may also run on observers. ECS agent.* fields shall be populated with details of the agent running on the host or observer where the event happened or the measurement was taken.

==== Agent Field Details

[options="header"]
|=====
| Field  | Description | Level

// ===============================================================

| agent.build.original
| Extended build information for the agent.

This field is intended to contain any build information that a data source may provide, no specific formatting is required.

type: keyword



example: `metricbeat version 7.6.0 (amd64), libbeat 7.6.0 [6a23e8f8f30f5001ba344e4e54d8d9cb82cb107c built 2020-02-05 23:10:10 +0000 UTC]`

| core

// ===============================================================

| agent.ephemeral_id
| Ephemeral identifier of this agent (if one exists).

This id normally changes across restarts, but `agent.id` does not.

type: keyword



example: `8a4f500f`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| agent.id
| Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists).

Example: For Beats this would be beat.id.

type: keyword



example: `8a4f500d`

| core

// ===============================================================

| agent.name
| Custom name of the agent.

This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if for example two Filebeat instances are running on the same host but a human readable separation is needed on which Filebeat instance data is coming from.

If no name is given, the name is often left empty.

type: keyword



example: `foo`

| core

// ===============================================================

| agent.type
| Type of the agent.

The agent type always stays the same and should be given by the agent used. In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if two Filebeat instances are run on the same machine.

type: keyword



example: `filebeat`

| core

// ===============================================================

| agent.version
| Version of the agent.

type: keyword



example: `6.0.0-rc2`

Note also that the `as` fields are not expected to be used directly at the root of the events.




[[ecs-client]]
=== Client Fields

A client is defined as the initiator of a network connection for events regarding sessions, connections, or bidirectional flow records.

For TCP events, the client is the initiator of the TCP connection that sends the SYN packet(s). For other protocols, the client is generally the initiator or requestor in the network transaction. Some systems use the term "originator" to refer the client in TCP connections. The client fields describe details about the system acting as the client in the network event. Client fields are usually populated in conjunction with server fields. Client fields are generally not populated for packet-level events.

Client / server representations can add semantic context to an exchange, which is helpful to visualize the data in certain situations. If your context falls in that category, you should still ensure that source and destination are filled appropriately.

==== Client Field Details

[options="header"]
|=====
| Field  | Description | Level

// ===============================================================

| client.address
| Some event client addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field.

Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is.

type: keyword



example: `example.com`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| client.top_level_domain
| The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com".

[[ecs-event]]
=== Event Fields

The event fields are used for context information about the log or metric event itself.

A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened. Log events must include the time at which the thing happened. Examples of log events include a process starting on a host, a network packet being sent from a source to a destination, or a network connection between a client and a server being initiated or closed. A metric is defined as an event containing one or more numerical measurements and the time at which the measurement was taken. Examples of metric events include memory pressure measured on a host and device temperature. See the `event.kind` definition in this section for additional details about metric and state events.

==== Event Field Details

[options="header"]
|=====
| Field  | Description | Level

// ===============================================================

| event.action
| The action captured by the event.

This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer.

type: keyword



example: `user-password-change`

| core

// ===============================================================

| event.category
| This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy.

`event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory.

This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories.

type: keyword


Note: this field should contain an array of values.




*Important*: The field value must be one of the following:

authentication, database, driver, file, host, iam, intrusion_detection, malware, network, package, process, web

To learn more about when to use which value, visit the page
<<ecs-allowed-values-event-category,allowed values for event.category>>


| core

// ===============================================================

| event.code
| Identification code for this event, if one exists.

Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID.

type: keyword



example: `4648`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| event.created
| event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline.

This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event.

In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source.

In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used.

type: date



example: `2016-05-23T08:05:34.857Z`

| core

// ===============================================================

| event.dataset
| Name of the dataset.

If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from.

It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name.

type: keyword



example: `apache.access`

| core

// ===============================================================

| event.duration
| Duration of the event in nanoseconds.

If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time.

type: long





| core

// ===============================================================

| event.end
| event.end contains the date when the event ended or when the activity was last observed.

type: date

// ===============================================================

| event.id
| Unique ID to describe the event.

type: keyword



example: `8a4f500d`

| core

// ===============================================================

| event.ingested
| Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store.

This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event.

In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`.

type: date



example: `2016-05-23T08:05:35.101Z`

| core

// ===============================================================

| event.kind
| This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy.

`event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events.

The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not.

type: keyword




*Important*: The field value must be one of the following:

alert, event, metric, state, pipeline_error, signal

To learn more about when to use which value, visit the page
<<ecs-allowed-values-event-kind,allowed values for event.kind>>


| core

// ===============================================================

| event.module
| Name of the module this data is coming from.

If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module.

type: keyword



example: `apache`

| core

// ===============================================================

| event.original
| Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity.

This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`.

type: keyword



example: `Sep 19 08:26:10 host CEF:0&#124;Security&#124; threatmanager&#124;1.0&#124;100&#124; worm successfully stopped&#124;10&#124;src=10.0.0.1 dst=2.1.2.2spt=1232`

| core

// ===============================================================

| event.outcome
| This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy.

`event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event.

Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective.

Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer.

Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense.

type: keyword




*Important*: The field value must be one of the following:

failure, success, unknown

To learn more about when to use which value, visit the page
<<ecs-allowed-values-event-outcome,allowed values for event.outcome>>


| core

// ===============================================================

| event.provider
| Source of the event.

Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd), or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing).

type: keyword



example: `kernel`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| event.reason
| Reason why this event happened, according to the source.

This describes the why of a particular action or outcome captured in the event. Where `event.action` captures the action from the event, `event.reason` describes why that action was taken. For example, a web proxy with an `event.action` which denied the request may also populate `event.reason` with the reason why (e.g. `blocked site`).

type: keyword



example: `Terminated an unexpected process`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| event.reference
| Reference URL linking to additional information about this event.

This URL links to a static definition of the this event. Alert events, indicated by `event.kind:alert`, are a common use case for this field.

type: keyword



example: `https://system.example.com/event/#0001234`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| event.risk_score
| Risk score or priority of the event (e.g. security solutions). Use your system's original value here.

type: float





| core

// ===============================================================

| event.risk_score_norm
| Normalized risk score or priority of the event, on a scale of 0 to 100.

This is mainly useful if you use more than one system that assigns risk scores, and you want to see a normalized value across all systems.

type: float





| extended

// ===============================================================

| event.sequence
| Sequence number of the event.

The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision.

type: long





| extended

// ===============================================================

| event.severity
| The numeric severity of the event according to your event source.

What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source.

The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`.

type: long



example: `7`

| core

// ===============================================================

| event.start
| event.start contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed.

type: date





| extended

// ===============================================================

| event.timezone
| This field should be populated when the event's timestamp does not include timezone information already (e.g. default Syslog timestamps). It's optional otherwise.

Acceptable timezone formats are: a canonical ID (e.g. "Europe/Amsterdam"), abbreviated (e.g. "EST") or an HH:mm differential (e.g. "-05:00").

type: keyword





| extended

// ===============================================================

| event.type
| This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy.

`event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization.

This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types.

type: keyword


Note: this field should contain an array of values.




*Important*: The field value must be one of the following:

access, admin, allowed, change, connection, creation, deletion, denied, end, error, group, info, installation, protocol, start, user

To learn more about when to use which value, visit the page
<<ecs-allowed-values-event-type,allowed values for event.type>>


| core

// ===============================================================

| event.url
| URL linking to an external system to continue investigation of this event.

This URL links to another system where in-depth investigation of the specific occurrence of this event can take place. Alert events, indicated by `event.kind:alert`, are a common use case for this field.

type: keyword



example: `https://mysystem.example.com/alert/5271dedb-f5b0-4218-87f0-4ac4870a38fe`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| log.syslog.severity.code
| The Syslog numeric severity of the log event, if available.

If the event source publishing via Syslog provides a different numeric severity value (e.g. firewall, IDS), your source's numeric severity should go to `event.severity`. If the event source does not specify a distinct severity, you can optionally copy the Syslog severity to `event.severity`.

type: long



example: `3`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| log.syslog.severity.name
| The Syslog numeric severity of the log event, if available.

If the event source publishing via Syslog provides a different severity value (e.g. firewall, IDS), your source's text severity should go to `log.level`. If the event source does not specify a distinct severity, you can optionally copy the Syslog severity to `log.level`.

[[ecs-server]]
=== Server Fields

A Server is defined as the responder in a network connection for events regarding sessions, connections, or bidirectional flow records.

For TCP events, the server is the receiver of the initial SYN packet(s) of the TCP connection. For other protocols, the server is generally the responder in the network transaction. Some systems actually use the term "responder" to refer the server in TCP connections. The server fields describe details about the system acting as the server in the network event. Server fields are usually populated in conjunction with client fields. Server fields are generally not populated for packet-level events.

Client / server representations can add semantic context to an exchange, which is helpful to visualize the data in certain situations. If your context falls in that category, you should still ensure that source and destination are filled appropriately.

==== Server Field Details

[options="header"]
|=====
| Field  | Description | Level

// ===============================================================

| server.address
| Some event server addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field.

[[ecs-service]]
=== Service Fields

The service fields describe the service for or from which the data was collected.

These fields help you find and correlate logs for a specific service and version.

==== Service Field Details

[options="header"]
|=====
| Field  | Description | Level

// ===============================================================

| service.ephemeral_id
| Ephemeral identifier of this service (if one exists).

This id normally changes across restarts, but `service.id` does not.

type: keyword



example: `8a4f500f`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| service.id
| Unique identifier of the running service. If the service is comprised of many nodes, the `service.id` should be the same for all nodes.

This id should uniquely identify the service. This makes it possible to correlate logs and metrics for one specific service, no matter which particular node emitted the event.

Note that if you need to see the events from one specific host of the service, you should filter on that `host.name` or `host.id` instead.

type: keyword



example: `d37e5ebfe0ae6c4972dbe9f0174a1637bb8247f6`

| core

// ===============================================================

| service.name
| Name of the service data is collected from.

The name of the service is normally user given. This allows for distributed services that run on multiple hosts to correlate the related instances based on the name.

In the case of Elasticsearch the `service.name` could contain the cluster name. For Beats the `service.name` is by default a copy of the `service.type` field if no name is specified.

type: keyword



example: `elasticsearch-metrics`

| core

// ===============================================================

| service.node.name
| Name of a service node.

This allows for two nodes of the same service running on the same host to be differentiated. Therefore, `service.node.name` should typically be unique across nodes of a given service.

In the case of Elasticsearch, the `service.node.name` could contain the unique node name within the Elasticsearch cluster. In cases where the service doesn't have the concept of a node name, the host name or container name can be used to distinguish running instances that make up this service. If those do not provide uniqueness (e.g. multiple instances of the service running on the same host) - the node name can be manually set.

type: keyword



example: `instance-0000000016`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| service.state
| Current state of the service.

type: keyword





| core

// ===============================================================

| service.type
| The type of the service data is collected from.

The type can be used to group and correlate logs and metrics from one service type.

Example: If logs or metrics are collected from Elasticsearch, `service.type` would be `elasticsearch`.

type: keyword



example: `elasticsearch`

| core

// ===============================================================

| service.version
| Version of the service the data was collected from.

This allows to look at a data set only for a specific version of a service.

type: keyword



example: `3.2.4`

| core

// ===============================================================

|=====

[options="header"]
|=====
| Field  | Description | Level

// ===============================================================

| source.address
| Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field.

Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is.

type: keyword





| extended

// ===============================================================

| source.bytes
| Bytes sent from the source to the destination.

type: long



example: `184`

| core

// ===============================================================

| source.packets
| Packets sent from the source to the destination.

type: long



example: `12`

| core

// ===============================================================

| source.port
| Port of the source.

type: long





| core

// ===============================================================

| source.registered_domain
| The highest registered source domain, stripped of the subdomain.

For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com".

This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk".

type: keyword



example: `example.com`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| source.top_level_domain
| The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com".

This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk".

type: keyword

[[ecs-vlan]]
=== VLAN Fields

The VLAN fields are used to identify 802.1q tag(s) of a packet, as well as ingress and egress VLAN associations of an observer in relation to a specific packet or connection.

Network.vlan fields are used to record a single VLAN tag, or the outer tag in the case of q-in-q encapsulations, for a packet or connection as observed, typically provided by a network sensor (e.g. Zeek, Wireshark) passively reporting on traffic.

Network.inner VLAN fields are used to report inner q-in-q 802.1q tags (multiple 802.1q encapsulations) as observed, typically provided by a network sensor  (e.g. Zeek, Wireshark) passively reporting on traffic. Network.inner VLAN fields should only be used in addition to network.vlan fields to indicate q-in-q tagging.

Observer.ingress and observer.egress VLAN values are used to record observer specific information when observer events contain discrete ingress and egress VLAN information, typically provided by firewalls, routers, or load balancers.

[[ecs-x509]]
=== x509 Certificate Fields

This implements the common core fields for x509 certificates. This information is likely logged with TLS sessions, digital signatures found in executable binaries, S/MIME information in email bodies, or analysis of files on disk. When only a single certificate is logged in an event, it should be nested under `file`. When hashes of the DER-encoded certificate are available, the `hash` data set should be populated as well (e.g. `file.hash.sha256`). For events that contain certificate information for both sides of the connection, the x509 object could be nested under the respective side of the connection information (e.g. `tls.server.x509`).
