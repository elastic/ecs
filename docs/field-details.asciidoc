[[ecs-base]]
=== Base Fields

The `base` field set contains all fields which are on the top level. These fields are common across all types of events.

==== Base Field Details

[options="header"]
|=====
| Field  | Description | Level

// ===============================================================

| @timestamp
| Date/time when the event originated.

This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.

If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.

Required field for all events.

type: date

example: `2016-05-23T08:05:34.853Z`

| core

// ===============================================================

| labels
| Custom key/value pairs.

Can be used to add meta information to events. Should not contain nested objects. All values are stored as keyword.

Example: `docker` and `k8s` labels.

type: object

example: `{'application': 'foo-bar', 'env': 'production'}`

| core

// ===============================================================

| message
| For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer.

For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.

If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.

type: text

example: `Hello World`

| core

// ===============================================================

| tags
| List of keywords used to tag each event.

type: keyword

example: `["production", "env2"]`

| core

// ===============================================================

|=====

[[ecs-agent]]
=== Agent Fields

The agent fields contain the data about the software entity, if any, that collects, detects, or observes events on a host, or takes measurements on a host.

Examples include Beats. Agents may also run on observers. ECS agent.* fields shall be populated with details of the agent running on the host or observer where the event happened or the measurement was taken.

==== Agent Field Details

[options="header"]
|=====
| Field  | Description | Level

// ===============================================================

| agent.ephemeral_id
| Ephemeral identifier of this agent (if one exists).

This id normally changes across restarts, but `agent.id` does not.

type: keyword

example: `8a4f500f`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| agent.id
| Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists).

Example: For Beats this would be beat.id.

type: keyword

example: `8a4f500d`

| core

// ===============================================================

| agent.name
| Custom name of the agent.

This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if for example two Filebeat instances are running on the same host but a human readable separation is needed on which Filebeat instance data is coming from.

If no name is given, the name is often left empty.

type: keyword

example: `foo`

| core

// ===============================================================

| agent.type
| Type of the agent.

The agent type stays always the same and should be given by the agent used. In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if two Filebeat instances are run on the same machine.

type: keyword

example: `filebeat`

| core

// ===============================================================

| agent.version
| Version of the agent.

type: keyword

example: `6.0.0-rc2`

| core

// ===============================================================

|=====

[[ecs-as]]
=== Autonomous System Fields

An autonomous system (AS) is a collection of connected Internet Protocol (IP) routing prefixes under the control of one or more network operators on behalf of a single administrative entity or domain that presents a common, clearly defined routing policy to the internet.

==== Autonomous System Field Details

[options="header"]
|=====
| Field  | Description | Level

// ===============================================================

| as.number

type: keyword

example: `Google LLC`

| extended

// ===============================================================

|=====

==== Field Reuse

The `as` fields are expected to be nested at: `client.as`, `destination.as`, `server.as`, `source.as`.

Note also that the `as` fields are not expected to be used directly at the top level.




[[ecs-client]]
=== Client Fields

A client is defined as the initiator of a network connection for events regarding sessions, connections, or bidirectional flow records.

For TCP events, the client is the initiator of the TCP connection that sends the SYN packet(s). For other protocols, the client is generally the initiator or requestor in the network transaction. Some systems use the term "originator" to refer the client in TCP connections. The client fields describe details about the system acting as the client in the network event. Client fields are usually populated in conjunction with server fields. Client fields are generally not populated for packet-level events.

Client / server representations can add semantic context to an exchange, which is helpful to visualize the data in certain situations. If your context falls in that category, you should still ensure that source and destination are filled appropriately.

==== Client Field Details

[options="header"]
|=====
| Field  | Description | Level

// ===============================================================

| client.address
| Some event client addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field.

Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is.

type: keyword

| The highest registered client domain, stripped of the subdomain.

For example, the registered domain for "foo.google.com" is "google.com".

This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk".

type: keyword

example: `google.com`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| client.top_level_domain
| The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for google.com is "com".

This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk".

type: keyword

example: `co.uk`

[[ecs-dns]]
=== DNS Fields

Fields describing DNS queries and answers.

DNS events should either represent a single DNS query prior to getting answers (`dns.type:query`) or they should represent a full exchange and contain the query details as well as all of the answers that were provided for this query (`dns.type:answer`).

==== DNS Field Details

[options="header"]
|=====
| Field  | Description | Level

// ===============================================================

| dns.answers
| An array containing an object for each answer section returned by the server.

The main keys that should be present in these objects are defined by ECS. Records that have more information may contain more keys than what ECS defines.

Not all DNS data sources give all details about DNS answers. At minimum, answer objects must contain the `data` key. If more information is available, map as much of it to ECS as possible, and add any additional fields to the answer objects as custom fields.

type: object



| extended

// ===============================================================

| dns.answers.class
| The class of DNS data contained in this resource record.

type: keyword

example: `IN`

type: keyword

example: `10.10.10.10`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| dns.answers.name
| The domain name to which this resource record pertains.

If a chain of CNAME is being resolved, each answer's `name` should be the one that corresponds with the answer's `data`. It should not simply be the original `question.name` repeated.

type: keyword

example: `www.google.com`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| dns.answers.ttl
| The time interval in seconds that this resource record may be cached before it should be discarded. Zero values mean that the data should not be cached.

| Array of 2 letter DNS header flags.

Expected values are: AA, TC, RD, RA, AD, CD, DO.

type: keyword

example: `['RD', 'RA']`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| dns.id
| The DNS packet identifier assigned by the program that generated the query. The identifier is copied to the response.

type: keyword

example: `62111`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| dns.op_code
| The DNS operation code that specifies the kind of query in the message. This value is set by the originator of a query and copied into the response.

type: keyword

If the name field contains non-printable characters (below 32 or above 126), those characters should be represented as escaped base 10 integers (\DDD). Back slashes and quotes should be escaped. Tabs, carriage returns, and line feeds should be converted to \t, \r, and \n respectively.

type: keyword

example: `www.google.com`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| dns.question.registered_domain
| The highest registered domain, stripped of the subdomain.

For example, the registered domain for "foo.google.com" is "google.com".

This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk".

type: keyword

example: `google.com`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| dns.question.subdomain
| The subdomain is all of the labels under the registered_domain.

example: `AAAA`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| dns.resolved_ip
| Array containing all IPs seen in `answers.data`.

The `answers` array can be difficult to use, because of the variety of data formats it can contain. Extracting all IP addresses seen in there to `dns.resolved_ip` makes it possible to index them as IP addresses, and makes them easier to visualize and query for.

type: ip

example: `['10.10.10.10', '10.10.10.11']`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| dns.response_code
| The DNS response code.

type: keyword

example: `NOERROR`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| dns.type
| The type of DNS event captured, query or answer.

If your source of DNS events only gives you DNS queries, you should only create dns events of type `dns.type:query`.

If your source of DNS events gives you answers as well, you should create one event per query (optionally as soon as the query is seen). And a second event containing all query details as well as an array of answers.

type: keyword

example: `answer`

[[ecs-event]]
=== Event Fields

The event fields are used for context information about the log or metric event itself.

A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened. Log events must include the time at which the thing happened. Examples of log events include a process starting on a host, a network packet being sent from a source to a destination, or a network connection between a client and a server being initiated or closed. A metric is defined as an event containing one or more numerical or categorical measurements and the time at which the measurement was taken. Examples of metric events include memory pressure measured on a host, or vulnerabilities measured on a scanned host.

==== Event Field Details

[options="header"]
|=====
| Field  | Description | Level

// ===============================================================

| event.action
| The action captured by the event.

This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer.

type: keyword

example: `user-password-change`

| core

// ===============================================================

| event.category
| Event category.

This contains high-level information about the contents of the event. It is more generic than `event.action`, in the sense that typically a category contains multiple actions. Warning: In future versions of ECS, we plan to provide a list of acceptable values for this field, please use with caution.

type: keyword

example: `user-management`

| core

// ===============================================================

| event.code
| Identification code for this event, if one exists.

Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID.

type: keyword

example: `4648`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| event.created
| event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline.

This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event.

In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source.

In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used.

type: date



| core

// ===============================================================

| event.dataset
| Name of the dataset.

If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from.

It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name.

type: keyword

example: `apache.access`

| core

| event.end contains the date when the event ended or when the activity was last observed.

type: date



| extended

// ===============================================================

| event.hash
| Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to demonstrate log integrity.

type: keyword

example: `123456789012345678901234567890ABCD`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| event.id
| Unique ID to describe the event.

type: keyword

example: `8a4f500d`

| core

// ===============================================================

| event.kind
| The kind of the event.

This gives information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event.  Examples are `event`, `state`, `alarm`. Warning: In future versions of ECS, we plan to provide a list of acceptable values for this field, please use with caution.

type: keyword

example: `state`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| event.module
| Name of the module this data is coming from.

If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module.

type: keyword

example: `apache`

| core

// ===============================================================

| event.original
| Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity.

This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`.

type: keyword

example: `Sep 19 08:26:10 host CEF:0&#124;Security&#124; threatmanager&#124;1.0&#124;100&#124; worm successfully stopped&#124;10&#124;src=10.0.0.1 dst=2.1.2.2spt=1232`

| core

// ===============================================================

| event.outcome
| The outcome of the event.

If the event describes an action, this fields contains the outcome of that action. Examples outcomes are `success` and `failure`. Warning: In future versions of ECS, we plan to provide a list of acceptable values for this field, please use with caution.

type: keyword

example: `success`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| event.provider
| Source of the event.

Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd), or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing).

type: keyword

example: `kernel`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| event.risk_score
| Risk score or priority of the event (e.g. security solutions). Use your system's original value here.

type: float



| core

// ===============================================================

| event.risk_score_norm
| Normalized risk score or priority of the event, on a scale of 0 to 100.

This is mainly useful if you use more than one system that assigns risk scores, and you want to see a normalized value across all systems.

type: float

| Sequence number of the event.

The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regarless of the timestamp precision.

type: long



| extended

// ===============================================================

| event.severity
| The numeric severity of the event according to your event source.

What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source.

The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`.

type: long

example: `7`

| core

// ===============================================================

| event.start
| event.start contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed.

type: date



| extended

// ===============================================================

| event.timezone
| This field should be populated when the event's timestamp does not include timezone information already (e.g. default Syslog timestamps). It's optional otherwise.

Acceptable timezone formats are: a canonical ID (e.g. "Europe/Amsterdam"), abbreviated (e.g. "EST") or an HH:mm differential (e.g. "-05:00").

type: long

example: `3`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| log.syslog.severity.name
| The Syslog numeric severity of the log event, if available.

If the event source publishing via Syslog provides a different severity value (e.g. firewall, IDS), your source's text severity should go to `log.level`. If the event source does not specify a distinct severity, you can optionally copy the Syslog severity to `log.level`.

=== Related Fields

This field set is meant to facilitate pivoting around a piece of data.

Some pieces of information can be seen in many places in an ECS event. To facilitate searching for them, store an array of all seen values to their corresponding field in `related.`.

A concrete example is IP addresses, which can be under host, observer, source, destination, client, server, and network.forwarded_ip. If you append all IPs to `related.ip`, you can then search for a given IP trivially, no matter where it appeared, by querying `related.ip:a.b.c.d`.

[[ecs-server]]
=== Server Fields

A Server is defined as the responder in a network connection for events regarding sessions, connections, or bidirectional flow records.

For TCP events, the server is the receiver of the initial SYN packet(s) of the TCP connection. For other protocols, the server is generally the responder in the network transaction. Some systems actually use the term "responder" to refer the server in TCP connections. The server fields describe details about the system acting as the server in the network event. Server fields are usually populated in conjunction with client fields. Server fields are generally not populated for packet-level events.

Client / server representations can add semantic context to an exchange, which is helpful to visualize the data in certain situations. If your context falls in that category, you should still ensure that source and destination are filled appropriately.

==== Server Field Details

[options="header"]
|=====
| Field  | Description | Level

// ===============================================================

| server.address
| Some event server addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field.

Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is.

| Bytes sent from the server to the client.

type: long

example: `184`

// ===============================================================

| server.registered_domain
| The highest registered server domain, stripped of the subdomain.

For example, the registered domain for "foo.google.com" is "google.com".

This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk".

type: keyword

example: `google.com`

// ===============================================================

| server.top_level_domain
| The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for google.com is "com".

This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk".

[[ecs-service]]
=== Service Fields

The service fields describe the service for or from which the data was collected.

These fields help you find and correlate logs for a specific service and version.

==== Service Field Details

[options="header"]
|=====
| Field  | Description | Level

// ===============================================================

| service.ephemeral_id
| Ephemeral identifier of this service (if one exists).

This id normally changes across restarts, but `service.id` does not.

type: keyword

example: `8a4f500f`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| service.id
| Unique identifier of the running service. If the service is comprised of many nodes, the `service.id` should be the same for all nodes.

This id should uniquely identify the service. This makes it possible to correlate logs and metrics for one specific service, no matter which particular node emitted the event.

Note that if you need to see the events from one specific host of the service, you should filter on that `host.name` or `host.id` instead.

type: keyword

example: `d37e5ebfe0ae6c4972dbe9f0174a1637bb8247f6`

| core

// ===============================================================

| service.name
| Name of the service data is collected from.

The name of the service is normally user given. This allows for distributed services that run on multiple hosts to correlate the related instances based on the name.

In the case of Elasticsearch the `service.name` could contain the cluster name. For Beats the `service.name` is by default a copy of the `service.type` field if no name is specified.

type: keyword

example: `elasticsearch-metrics`

| core

// ===============================================================

| service.node.name
| Name of a service node.

This allows for two nodes of the same service running on the same host to be differentiated. Therefore, `service.node.name` should typically be unique across nodes of a given service.

In the case of Elasticsearch, the `service.node.name` could contain the unique node name within the Elasticsearch cluster. In cases where the service doesn't have the concept of a node name, the host name or container name can be used to distinguish running instances that make up this service. If those do not provide uniqueness (e.g. multiple instances of the service running on the same host) - the node name can be manually set.

type: keyword

example: `instance-0000000016`

| extended

// ===============================================================

| service.state
| Current state of the service.

type: keyword



| core

// ===============================================================

| service.type
| The type of the service data is collected from.

The type can be used to group and correlate logs and metrics from one service type.

Example: If logs or metrics are collected from Elasticsearch, `service.type` would be `elasticsearch`.

type: keyword

example: `elasticsearch`

| core

// ===============================================================

| service.version
| Version of the service the data was collected from.

This allows to look at a data set only for a specific version of a service.

type: keyword

example: `3.2.4`

| core

// ===============================================================
