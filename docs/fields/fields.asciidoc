== {ecs} Field Reference

This is the documentation of ECS version 8.11.0.

ECS defines multiple groups of related fields. They are called "field sets".
The <<ecs-base,Base>> field set is the only one whose fields are defined
at the root of the event.

All other field sets are defined as objects in {es}, under which
all fields are defined.

For a single page representation of all fields, please see the
{ecs_github_repo_link}/generated/csv/fields.csv[generated CSV of fields].
