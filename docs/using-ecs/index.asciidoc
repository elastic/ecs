== Using ECS

ECS fields follow a series of guidelines, to ensure a consistent and predictable
feel, across various use cases.

If you're new to ECS and would like an introduction on implementing and using
the schema, check out the <<ecs-getting-started>> guide.

Whether you're trying to recall a field name, implementing a solution that
follows ECS, or proposing a change to the schema, the <<ecs-guidelines>> section
will help get you there.

<<ecs-principles-design>> are a set of considerations used to help guide the ECS project.

If you're wondering how to best capture event details that don't map to existing
ECS fields, head over to <<ecs-custom-fields-in-ecs>>.
