=== Guidelines and Best Practices

The {ecs} schema serves best when you follow schema guidelines and best
practices.

==== Types of fields

ECS defines "Core" and "Extended" fields.

* *Core fields.* Fields that are the most common across all use cases.
  Focus on populating these fields first. If consuming ECS events, expect
  these fields to be populated in most situations.

* *Extended fields.* Any fields that are not a core field.
  Extended fields may apply to more narrow use cases, or may be more open
  to interpretation depending on the use case. Extended fields are more likely to
  change over time.

==== General guidelines

* The document MUST have the `@timestamp` field.
* Use the {ref}/mapping-types.html[data types]
  defined for an ECS field.
* Use the `ecs.version` field to define which version of ECS is used.
* Map as many fields as possible to ECS.

===== Guidelines for field names

* *Field names must be lower case*

* *Combine words using underscore*

* *No special characters except underscore*

* *Use present tense* unless field describes historical information.

* *Use singular and plural names properly* to reflect the field content.
** For example, use `requests_per_sec` rather than `request_per_sec`.

* *Use prefixes for all fields*, except for the base fields.
** For example, all `host` fields are prefixed with `host.`

* *Separate prefixes by nesting* with dots
** The document structure should be nested JSON objects.
   If you use Beats or Logstash, the nesting of JSON objects is done for you automatically.
   If you're ingesting to Elasticsearch using the API, your fields must be nested
   objects, not strings containing dots.
** See <<dot-notation>> for more details.

* *General to specific*. Organise the prefixes from general to specific to
  allow grouping fields into objects with a prefix like `host.*`.

* *Avoid repetition* or stuttering of words
** If part of the field name is already in the prefix,
   avoid repeat it. Example: `host.host_ip` should be `host.ip`.
** Exceptions can be made, when changing the name of the field would break a
   strong convention in the community. Example: `host.hostname` is an exception to this rule.

* *Avoid abbreviations when possible*
** Exceptions can be made, when the name used for the concept is too strongly
   in favor of the abbreviation. Example: all `ip` fields are an exception to this rule.
