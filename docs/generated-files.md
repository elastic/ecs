The core of the ECS spec is the files in `schemas/*`. Many files are generated
from these.

Here's where you can find some of them:

- `generated/elasticsearch/*`: Elasticsearch 6 and 7 sample index templates
- `generated/csv/fields.csv`: CSV file listing all ECS fields
- `generated/ecs/fields_flat.yml`: Intermediary file. Lists all fields, all of the
  default are filled in, reusable fields are explicitly listed. This is the in-memory
  representation of what the generators use. Can be used by third-party generators
  to build on top of ECS.
- `generated/legacy/*`: files as generated by the legacy generator.
