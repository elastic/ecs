=== Experimental Artifacts

ECS maintains a collection of experimental artifacts. The ECS artifacts are various files generated directly based on the ECS schema, such as index templates and CSV files. Users can also generate their own custom artifacts using the scripts also available in the project's repo.

The artifacts can be found in the {ecs_github_repo_link}/generated#artifacts-generated-from-ecs ECS Github repo.
