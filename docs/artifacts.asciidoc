=== Generated Artifacts

ECS maintains a collection of artifact files generated directly from the ECS schema, including index templates and CSV files.

The artifacts can be found in the {ecs_github_repo_link}/generated#artifacts-generated-from-ecs[ECS Github repo].

Users can generate custom artifacts, unique for their own deployments, using the project's tooling. See the ECS tooling {ecs_github_repo_link}/USAGE.md[usage documentation] for more detail.
