=== ECS Experimental Artifacts

ECS maintains a collection of experimental artifacts. These artifacts are various files generated directly based on the ECS schema, such as index templates and CSV files.

The artifacts can be found in the {ecs_github_repo_link}/generated#artifacts-generated-from-ecs[ECS Github repo].

Users can generate their own custom artifacts using the project's tooling. See the ECS tooling {ecs_github_repo_link}/USAGE.md[usage documentation] for more detail.
