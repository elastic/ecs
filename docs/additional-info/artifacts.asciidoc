=== Generated Artifacts

ECS maintains a collection of artifacts which are generated based on the schema. Examples include Elasticsearch index templates, CSV, and Beats field mappings. The maintained artifacts can be found in the {ecs_github_repo_link}/generated#artifacts-generated-from-ecs[ECS Github repo].

Users can generate custom versions of these artifacts using the ECS project's tooling. See the tooling {ecs_github_repo_link}/USAGE.md[usage documentation] for more detail.
