# Using ECS [ecs-using-ecs]

ECS fields follow a series of guidelines, to ensure a consistent and predictable feel, across various use cases.

If you're new to ECS and would like an introduction on implementing and using the schema, check out the [Getting started](/reference/ecs-getting-started.md) guide.

Whether you're trying to recall a field name, implementing a solution that follows ECS, or proposing a change to the schema, the [Guidelines and best practices](/reference/ecs-guidelines.md) section will help get you there.

[Design principles](/reference/ecs-principles-design.md) are a set of considerations used to help guide the ECS project.

If you're wondering how to best capture event details that don't map to existing ECS fields, head over to [Custom fields](/reference/ecs-custom-fields-in-ecs.md).
