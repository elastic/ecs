# Interface fields [ecs-interface]

The interface fields are used to record ingress and egress interface information when reported by an observer (e.g. firewall, router, load balancer) in the context of the observer handling a network connection.  In the case of a single observer interface (e.g. network sensor on a span port) only the observer.ingress information should be populated.

## Interface field details [_interface_field_details]

| Field | Description | Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $$$field-interface-alias$$$ [interface.alias](#field-interface-alias) | Interface alias as reported by the system, typically used in firewall implementations for e.g. inside, outside, or dmz logical interface naming.<br><br>type: keyword<br><br>example: `outside` | extended |
| $$$field-interface-id$$$ [interface.id](#field-interface-id) | Interface ID as reported by an observer (typically SNMP interface ID).<br><br>type: keyword<br><br>example: `10` | extended |
| $$$field-interface-name$$$ [interface.name](#field-interface-name) | Interface name as reported by the system.<br><br>type: keyword<br><br>example: `eth0` | extended |

## Field reuse [_field_reuse]

The `interface` fields are expected to be nested at:

* `observer.egress.interface`
* `observer.ingress.interface`

Note also that the `interface` fields are not expected to be used directly at the root of the events.
