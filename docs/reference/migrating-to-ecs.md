# Migrating to ECS [migrating-to-ecs]

There are multiple ways to reap the benefit of ECS. The simplest is to use [Products and Solutions that Support ECS](/reference/ecs-products-solutions.md).

If you have a custom pipeline or application you would like to convert to ECS, please have a look at [Map custom data to ECS](/reference/ecs-converting.md).
