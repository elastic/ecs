# Generated artifacts [ecs-artifacts]

ECS maintains a collection of artifacts which are generated based on the schema. Examples include Elasticsearch index templates, CSV, and Beats field mappings. The maintained artifacts can be found in the [ECS Github repo](https://github.com/elastic/ecs/blob/master/generated#artifacts-generated-from-ecs).

Users can generate custom versions of these artifacts using the ECS projectâ€™s tooling. See the tooling [usage documentation](https://github.com/elastic/ecs/blob/master/USAGE.md) for more detail.
