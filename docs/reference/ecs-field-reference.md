# ECS field reference [ecs-field-reference]

This is the documentation of ECS version 9.0.0.

ECS defines multiple groups of related fields. They are called "field sets". The [Base](/reference/ecs-base.md) field set is the only one whose fields are defined at the root of the event.

All other field sets are defined as objects in Elasticsearch, under which all fields are defined.

For a single page representation of all fields, please see the [generated CSV of fields](https://github.com/elastic/ecs/blob/master/generated/csv/fields.csv).
