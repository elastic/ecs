# Rule fields [ecs-rule]

Rule fields are used to capture the specifics of any observer or agent rules that generate alerts or other notable events.

Examples of data sources that would populate the rule fields include: network admission control platforms, network or host IDS/IPS, network firewalls, web application firewalls, url filters, endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems, etc.
