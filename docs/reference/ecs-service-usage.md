# Service fields usage and examples [ecs-service-usage]

Here are the subjects covered in this page.

* [Field reuse](#ecs-service-usage-field-reuse)

    * [Service fields at the Root of an Event](#ecs-service-usage-service-at-root)
    * [Describing external services in an invocation relationship](#ecs-service-usage-origin-target)



## Field reuse [ecs-service-usage-field-reuse]

The service fields can be used to * [describe the service for or from which the data was collected](#ecs-service-usage-service-at-root) (i.e. observed service) * or to [describe external services that have a direct invocation relationship](#ecs-service-usage-origin-target) to the observed service


### Service fields at the root of an event [ecs-service-usage-service-at-root]

Use the service fields at the root of an event to describe the service the event primarily relates to. An example for this use case is a log entry being recorded for a particular service or appplication (e.g. `MyService`):

```json
{
  "service": { <1>
    "id": "d37e5ebfe0ae6c4972dbe9f0174a1637bb8247f6",
    "name": "MyService",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  ...
}
```

1. Describes the service for which the log entry is being captured



### Describing external services in an invocation relationship [ecs-service-usage-origin-target]

Multiple services can be in an invocation relationship. Where it is possible to apply [distributed tracing](docs-content://solutions/observability/apps/traces-2.md) on all the involved services describe the individual services [using root-level service fields](#ecs-service-usage-service-at-root) and use the [tracing fields](/reference/ecs-related.md) to represent the invocation relationship.

There are situations when distributed tracing cannot be applied on some external services that are in an invocation relationship to an observed service. Letâ€™s consider the example of a service `MyService` being deployed on a cloud provider with an upstream API gateway that passes through requests to `MyService` (with additional context information about the API gateway itself). To describe the API gateway as a service from the perspective of `MyService` one can self-nest the service fields under `service.origin`:

```json
{
  "service": { <1>
    "id": "d37e5ebfe0ae6c4972dbe9f0174a1637bb8247f6",
    "name": "MyService",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "origin": { <2>
      "id": "api-gateway-46372994637e2b4567",
      "name": "SomeGateway",
      "version" "2.5.1",
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

1. Describes the observed service that receives the inbound request from an external service
2. Describes the origin external service of the inbound request


Similar to the usage of `service.origin` fields the service fields can be self-nested under `service.target.*` to describe an external target service for an outbound request:

```json
{
  "service": { <1>
    "id": "d37e5ebfe0ae6c4972dbe9f0174a1637bb8247f6",
    "name": "MyService",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "target": { <2>
      "id": "sms-service-0xe6c4272dbeAf0134",
      "name": "ManagedSMSService",
      "version": "1.9.0",
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

1. Describes the observed service that emits the outbound request to an external service
2. Describes the target external service of the outbound request


Note that `service.origin.*` and `service.target.*` fields should only be used on events that represent an invocation relationship.
