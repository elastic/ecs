# Process fields [ecs-process]

These fields contain information about a process.

These fields can help you correlate metrics information with a process id/name from a log message.  The `process.pid` often stays in the metric itself and is copied to the global field for correlation.

## Process field details [_process_field_details]

| $$$field-process-interactive$$$ [process.interactive](#field-process-interactive) | Whether the process is connected to an interactive shell.<br><br>Process interactivity is inferred from the processes file descriptors. If the character device for the controlling tty is the same as stdin and stderr for the process, the process is considered interactive.<br><br>Note: A non-interactive process can belong to an interactive session and is simply one that does not have open file descriptors reading the controlling TTY on FD 0 (stdin) or writing to the controlling TTY on FD 2 (stderr). A backgrounded process is still considered interactive if stdin and stderr are connected to the controlling TTY.<br><br>type: boolean<br><br>example: `True`<br><br>![OTel Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry) [![match](https://img.shields.io/badge/match-93c93e?style=flat)](/reference/ecs-opentelemetry.md#ecs-opentelemetry-relation) [process.interactive](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/process/#process-interactive) | extended |

## Field reuse [_field_reuse]

The `process` fields are expected to be nested at:

* `process.entry_leader`
* `process.entry_leader.parent`
* `process.entry_leader.parent.session_leader`
* `process.group_leader`
* `process.parent`
* `process.parent.group_leader`
* `process.previous`
* `process.responsible`
* `process.session_leader`
* `process.session_leader.parent`
* `process.session_leader.parent.session_leader`

Note also that the `process` fields may be used directly at the root of the events.
