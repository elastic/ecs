# Base fields [ecs-base]

The `base` field set contains all fields which are at the root of the events. These fields are common across all types of events.

## Base field details [_base_field_details]

| Field | Description | Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $$$field-timestamp$$$ [@timestamp](#field-timestamp) | Date/time when the event originated.<br><br>This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.<br><br>If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.<br><br>Required field for all events.<br><br>type: date<br><br>example: `2016-05-23T08:05:34.853Z`<br><br>![OTel Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry) [![otlp](https://img.shields.io/badge/OTLP-ffdcb2?style=flat)](/reference/ecs-opentelemetry.md#ecs-opentelemetry-relation) [time_unix_nano](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aopen-telemetry%2Fopentelemetry-proto+%22\+time_unix_nano+%22&type=code)<br><br>![OTel Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry) [![otlp](https://img.shields.io/badge/OTLP-ffdcb2?style=flat)](/reference/ecs-opentelemetry.md#ecs-opentelemetry-relation) [observed_time_unix_nano](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aopen-telemetry%2Fopentelemetry-proto+%22\+observed_time_unix_nano+%22&type=code)<br><br>![OTel Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry) [![otlp](https://img.shields.io/badge/OTLP-ffdcb2?style=flat)](/reference/ecs-opentelemetry.md#ecs-opentelemetry-relation) [start_time_unix_nano](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aopen-telemetry%2Fopentelemetry-proto+%22\+start_time_unix_nano+%22&type=code)<br><br>**Note:** On logs, events and metrics, `time_unix_nano` defines the time of the event. For logs, `observed_time_unix_nano` defines the time when the event was observed by the collection system. On spans, `start_time_unix_nano` represents the start time of the span. | core |
| $$$field-labels$$$ [labels](#field-labels) | Custom key/value pairs.<br><br>Can be used to add meta information to events. Should not contain nested objects. All values are stored as keyword.<br><br>Example: `docker` and `k8s` labels.<br><br>type: object<br><br>example: `{"application": "foo-bar", "env": "production"}`<br><br>![OTel Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry) [![related](https://img.shields.io/badge/related-efc20d?style=flat)](/reference/ecs-opentelemetry.md#ecs-opentelemetry-relation) [k8s.pod.label](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/k8s/#k8s-pod-label)<br><br>![OTel Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry) [![related](https://img.shields.io/badge/related-efc20d?style=flat)](/reference/ecs-opentelemetry.md#ecs-opentelemetry-relation) [container.label](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/container/#container-label) | core |
| $$$field-message$$$ [message](#field-message) | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer.<br><br>For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.<br><br>If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.<br><br>type: match_only_text<br><br>example: `Hello World`<br><br>![OTel Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry) [![otlp](https://img.shields.io/badge/OTLP-ffdcb2?style=flat)](/reference/ecs-opentelemetry.md#ecs-opentelemetry-relation) [body](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aopen-telemetry%2Fopentelemetry-proto+%22\+body+%22&type=code)<br><br>**Note:** The `body` in OTLP is of type `Any` and can be either an unstructured log message or a structured event. | core |
| $$$field-tags$$$ [tags](#field-tags) | List of keywords used to tag each event.<br><br>type: keyword<br><br>Note: This field should contain an array of values.<br><br>example: `["production", "env2"]` | core |
