# URL fields [ecs-url]

URL fields provide support for complete or partial URLs, and supports the breaking down into scheme, domain, path, and so on.

## URL field details [_url_field_details]

| Field | Description | Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $$$field-url-domain$$$ [url.domain](#field-url-domain) | Domain of the url, such as "www.elastic.co".<br><br>In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a domain name. In this case, the IP address would go to the `domain` field.<br><br>If the URL contains a literal IPv6 address enclosed by `[` and `]` (IETF RFC 2732), the `[` and `]` characters should also be captured in the `domain` field.<br><br>type: keyword<br><br>example: `www.elastic.co`<br>![OTel Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry) [![match](https://img.shields.io/badge/match-93c93e?style=flat)](/reference/ecs-opentelemetry.md#ecs-opentelemetry-relation) [url.domain](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/url/#url-domain) | extended |
| $$$field-url-extension$$$ [url.extension](#field-url-extension) | The field contains the file extension from the original request url, excluding the leading dot.<br><br>The file extension is only set if it exists, as not every url has a file extension.<br><br>The leading period must not be included. For example, the value must be "png", not ".png".<br><br>Note that when the file name has multiple extensions (example.tar.gz), only the last one should be captured ("gz", not "tar.gz").<br><br>type: keyword<br><br>example: `png`<br>![OTel Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry) [![match](https://img.shields.io/badge/match-93c93e?style=flat)](/reference/ecs-opentelemetry.md#ecs-opentelemetry-relation) [url.extension](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/url/#url-extension) | extended |
| $$$field-url-fragment$$$ [url.fragment](#field-url-fragment) | Portion of the url after the `#`, such as "top".<br><br>The `#` is not part of the fragment.<br><br>type: keyword<br><br>![OTel Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry) [![match](https://img.shields.io/badge/match-93c93e?style=flat)](/reference/ecs-opentelemetry.md#ecs-opentelemetry-relation) [url.fragment](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/url/#url-fragment) | extended |
| $$$field-url-full$$$ [url.full](#field-url-full) | If full URLs are important to your use case, they should be stored in `url.full`, whether this field is reconstructed or present in the event source.<br><br>type: wildcard<br><br>Multi-fields:<br><br>* url.full.text (type: match_only_text)<br><br>example: `https://www.elastic.co:443/search?q=elasticsearch#top`<br>![OTel Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry) [![match](https://img.shields.io/badge/match-93c93e?style=flat)](/reference/ecs-opentelemetry.md#ecs-opentelemetry-relation) [url.full](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/url/#url-full) | extended |
| $$$field-url-original$$$ [url.original](#field-url-original) | Unmodified original url as seen in the event source.<br><br>Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path.<br><br>This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not.<br><br>type: wildcard<br><br>Multi-fields:<br><br>* url.original.text (type: match_only_text)<br><br>example: `https://www.elastic.co:443/search?q=elasticsearch#top or /search?q=elasticsearch`<br>![OTel Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry) [![match](https://img.shields.io/badge/match-93c93e?style=flat)](/reference/ecs-opentelemetry.md#ecs-opentelemetry-relation) [url.original](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/url/#url-original) | extended |
| $$$field-url-password$$$ [url.password](#field-url-password) | Password of the request.<br><br>type: keyword<br><br> | extended |
| $$$field-url-path$$$ [url.path](#field-url-path) | Path of the request, such as "/search".<br><br>type: wildcard<br><br>![OTel Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry) [![match](https://img.shields.io/badge/match-93c93e?style=flat)](/reference/ecs-opentelemetry.md#ecs-opentelemetry-relation) [url.path](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/url/#url-path) | extended |
| $$$field-url-port$$$ [url.port](#field-url-port) | Port of the request, such as 443.<br><br>type: long<br><br>example: `443`<br>![OTel Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry) [![match](https://img.shields.io/badge/match-93c93e?style=flat)](/reference/ecs-opentelemetry.md#ecs-opentelemetry-relation) [url.port](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/url/#url-port) | extended |
| $$$field-url-query$$$ [url.query](#field-url-query) | The query field describes the query string of the request, such as "q=elasticsearch".<br><br>The `?` is excluded from the query string. If a URL contains no `?`, there is no query field. If there is a `?` but no query, the query field exists with an empty string. The `exists` query can be used to differentiate between the two cases.<br><br>type: keyword<br><br>![OTel Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry) [![match](https://img.shields.io/badge/match-93c93e?style=flat)](/reference/ecs-opentelemetry.md#ecs-opentelemetry-relation) [url.query](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/url/#url-query) | extended |
| $$$field-url-registered-domain$$$ [url.registered_domain](#field-url-registered-domain) | The highest registered url domain, stripped of the subdomain.<br><br>For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com".<br><br>This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (https://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk".<br><br>type: keyword<br><br>example: `example.com`<br>![OTel Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry) [![match](https://img.shields.io/badge/match-93c93e?style=flat)](/reference/ecs-opentelemetry.md#ecs-opentelemetry-relation) [url.registered_domain](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/url/#url-registered-domain) | extended |
| $$$field-url-scheme$$$ [url.scheme](#field-url-scheme) | Scheme of the request, such as "https".<br><br>Note: The `:` is not part of the scheme.<br><br>type: keyword<br><br>example: `https`<br>![OTel Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry) [![match](https://img.shields.io/badge/match-93c93e?style=flat)](/reference/ecs-opentelemetry.md#ecs-opentelemetry-relation) [url.scheme](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/url/#url-scheme) | extended |
| $$$field-url-subdomain$$$ [url.subdomain](#field-url-subdomain) | The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all of the names except the host name under the registered_domain.  In a partially qualified domain, or if the the qualification level of the full name cannot be determined, subdomain contains all of the names below the registered domain.<br><br>For example the subdomain portion of "www.east.mydomain.co.uk" is "east". If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com", the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period.<br><br>type: keyword<br><br>example: `east`<br>![OTel Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry) [![match](https://img.shields.io/badge/match-93c93e?style=flat)](/reference/ecs-opentelemetry.md#ecs-opentelemetry-relation) [url.subdomain](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/url/#url-subdomain) | extended |
| $$$field-url-top-level-domain$$$ [url.top_level_domain](#field-url-top-level-domain) | The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com".<br><br>This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (https://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk".<br><br>type: keyword<br><br>example: `co.uk`<br>![OTel Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry) [![match](https://img.shields.io/badge/match-93c93e?style=flat)](/reference/ecs-opentelemetry.md#ecs-opentelemetry-relation) [url.top_level_domain](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/url/#url-top-level-domain) | extended |
| $$$field-url-username$$$ [url.username](#field-url-username) | Username of the request.<br><br>type: keyword<br><br> | extended |

## Field reuse [_field_reuse]

The `url` fields are expected to be nested at:

* `threat.enrichments.indicator.url`
* `threat.indicator.url`

Note also that the `url` fields may be used directly at the root of the events.
