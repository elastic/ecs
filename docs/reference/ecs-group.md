# Group fields [ecs-group]

The group fields are meant to represent groups that are relevant to the event.

## Group field details [_group_field_details]

| Field | Description | Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $$$field-group-domain$$$ [group.domain](#field-group-domain) | Name of the directory the group is a member of.<br><br>For example, an LDAP or Active Directory domain name.<br><br>type: keyword | extended |
| $$$field-group-id$$$ [group.id](#field-group-id) | Unique identifier for the group on the system/platform.<br><br>type: keyword | extended |
| $$$field-group-name$$$ [group.name](#field-group-name) | Name of the group.<br><br>type: keyword | extended |

## Field reuse [_field_reuse]

The `group` fields are expected to be nested at:

* `process.attested_groups`
* `process.group`
* `process.real_group`
* `process.saved_group`
* `process.supplemental_groups`
* `user.group`

Note also that the `group` fields may be used directly at the root of the events.
