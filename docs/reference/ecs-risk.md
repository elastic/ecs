# Risk information fields [ecs-risk]

Fields for describing risk score and risk level of entities such as hosts and users. These fields are not allowed to be nested under `event.*`. Please continue to use `event.risk_score` and `event.risk_score_norm` for event risk.

::::{warning}
These fields are in beta and are subject to change.

## Risk information field details [_risk_information_field_details]

| Field | Description | Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $$$field-risk-calculated-level$$$ [risk.calculated_level](#field-risk-calculated-level) | A risk classification level calculated by an internal system as part of entity analytics and entity risk scoring.<br><br>type: keyword<br><br>example: `High` | extended |
| $$$field-risk-calculated-score$$$ [risk.calculated_score](#field-risk-calculated-score) | A risk classification score calculated by an internal system as part of entity analytics and entity risk scoring.<br><br>type: float<br><br>example: `880.73` | extended |
| $$$field-risk-calculated-score-norm$$$ [risk.calculated_score_norm](#field-risk-calculated-score-norm) | A risk classification score calculated by an internal system as part of entity analytics and entity risk scoring, and normalized to a range of 0 to 100.<br><br>type: float<br><br>example: `88.73` | extended |
| $$$field-risk-static-level$$$ [risk.static_level](#field-risk-static-level) | A risk classification level obtained from outside the system, such as from some external Threat Intelligence Platform.<br><br>type: keyword<br><br>example: `High` | extended |
| $$$field-risk-static-score$$$ [risk.static_score](#field-risk-static-score) | A risk classification score obtained from outside the system, such as from some external Threat Intelligence Platform.<br><br>type: float<br><br>example: `830.0` | extended |
| $$$field-risk-static-score-norm$$$ [risk.static_score_norm](#field-risk-static-score-norm) | A risk classification score obtained from outside the system, such as from some external Threat Intelligence Platform, and normalized to a range of 0 to 100.<br><br>type: float<br><br>example: `83.0` | extended |

## Field reuse [_field_reuse]

The `risk` fields are expected to be nested at:

* `host.risk`
* `user.risk`

Note also that the `risk` fields are not expected to be used directly at the root of the events.
