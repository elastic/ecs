# Autonomous System fields [ecs-as]

An autonomous system (AS) is a collection of connected Internet Protocol (IP) routing prefixes under the control of one or more network operators on behalf of a single administrative entity or domain that presents a common, clearly defined routing policy to the internet.

## Autonomous System field details [_autonomous_system_field_details]

| Field | Description | Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $$$field-as-number$$$ [as.number](#field-as-number) | Unique number allocated to the autonomous system. The autonomous system number (ASN) uniquely identifies each network on the Internet.<br><br>type: long<br><br>example: `15169` | extended |
| $$$field-as-organization-name$$$ [as.organization.name](#field-as-organization-name) | Organization name.<br><br>type: keyword<br><br>Multi-fields:<br><br>* as.organization.name.text (type: match_only_text)<br><br>example: `Google LLC` | extended |

## Field reuse [_field_reuse]

The `as` fields are expected to be nested at:

* `client.as`
* `destination.as`
* `server.as`
* `source.as`
* `threat.enrichments.indicator.as`
* `threat.indicator.as`

Note also that the `as` fields are not expected to be used directly at the root of the events.
