# Device fields [ecs-device]

Fields that describe a device instance and its characteristics. Data collected for applications and processes running on a (mobile) device can be enriched with these fields to describe the identity, type and other characteristics of the device.

This field group definition is based on the Device namespace of the OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions (https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/resource/semantic_conventions/device/).

::::{warning}
These fields are in beta and are subject to change.

| Field | Description | Level |
| --- | --- | --- |

The identifier must not change across application sessions but stay fixed for an instance of a (mobile) device.<br><br>On iOS, this value must be equal to the vendor identifier (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/1620059-identifierforvendor). On Android, this value must be equal to the Firebase Installation ID or a globally unique UUID which is persisted across sessions in your application.<br><br>For GDPR and data protection law reasons this identifier should not carry information that would allow to identify a user.<br><br>type: keyword<br><br>example: `00000000-54b3-e7c7-0000-000046bffd97`<br><br>![OTel Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry) [![match](https://img.shields.io/badge/match-93c93e?style=flat)](/reference/ecs-opentelemetry.md#ecs-opentelemetry-relation) [device.id](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/device/#device-id) | extended |
