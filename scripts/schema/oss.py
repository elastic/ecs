# This script performs a best effort fallback of basic data types to equivalent
# OSS data types.
# Note however that not all basic data types have an OSS replacement.
#
# The way this script is currently written, it has to be run on the fields *before*
# the cleaner script applies defaults, as there's no concept of defaults here.
# But since it navigates using the visitor script, it can easily be moved around
# in the chain, provided we add support for defaults as well.
#
# For now, no warning is output on basic fields that don't have a fallback.
# This could be improved if ECS starts using such types.
