      beta: This field is beta and subject to change.
      dashed_name: process-same-as-process
      description: 'This boolean is used to identify if a leader process is the same
        as the top level process.

        For example, if `process.group_leader.same_as_process = true`, it means the
        process event in question is the leader of its process group. Details under
        `process.*` like `pid` would be the same under `process.group_leader.*` The
        same applies for both `process.session_leader` and `process.entry_leader`.

        This field exists to the benefit of EQL and other rule engines since it''s
        not possible to compare equality between two fields in a single document.
        e.g `process.entity_id` = `process.group_leader.entity_id` (top level process
        is the process group leader) OR `process.entity_id` = `process.entry_leader.entity_id`
        (top level process is the entry session leader)

        Instead these rules could be written like: `process.group_leader.same_as_process:
        true` OR `process.entry_leader.same_as_process: true`

        Note: This field is only set on `process.entry_leader`, `process.session_leader`
        and `process.group_leader`.'
      example: true
      flat_name: process.same_as_process
      level: extended
      name: same_as_process
      normalize: []
      short: This boolean is used to identify if a leader process is the same as the
        top level process.
