# ECS field reference [ecs-field-reference]

This is the documentation of ECS version {{ ecs_generated_version }}.

ECS defines multiple groups of related fields. They are called "field sets". The [Base](/reference/ecs-base.md) field set is the only one whose fields are defined at the root of the event.

All other field sets are defined as objects in {{ es }}, under which all fields are defined.

For a single page representation of all fields, please see the [generated CSV of fields](https://github.com/elastic/ecs/blob/master/generated/csv/fields.csv).
