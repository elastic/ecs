// The dataset fields are part of the new [indexing
// strategy](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/docs/ingest_manager/index.asciidoc#indexing-strategy-1).
// These fields are used to determine into which index the data is shipped in
// Elasticsearch and allow efficient querying of data. Initially these fields
// are mainly used by data shipped by the Elastic Agent but any time series
// data shipper should switch to using data streams and the new indexing
// strategy with these fields.
// All three fields are `constant_keyword` fields.
type Dataset struct {
	// Type of the dataset.
	// The type of the dataset can be `logs` or `metrics`. More types can be
	// added in the future but no other types then the one describe here should
	// be used.
	Type string `ecs:"type"`

	// Dataset name describes the structure of the data.
	// The dataset name describes the structure of the data. All data shipped
	// into a single dataset should have the same or very similar data
	// structure. For example `system.cpu` and `system.disk` are two different
	// datasets as they have very different fields.
	// The name of the dataset should be descriptive of the data and it is
	// encourage to use `.` to combine multiple words. All characters which are
	// allowed in index names can be used for the dataset except `-`.
	// The default for dataset is `generic`.
	Name string `ecs:"name"`

	// Namespace of the dataset.
	// This is the namespace used in your index. The namespace is used to
	// separate the same structure into different Data Streams. For example if
	// nginx logs are shipped for testing and production into the same cluster,
	// two different namespaces can be used. This allows to assign different
	// ILM policies as an example.
	// The default value for a namespace is `default`.
	Namespace string `ecs:"namespace"`
